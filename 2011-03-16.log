<span class="irc-date">[1:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I'm going to bed tonight. my son has become a hellion at school (he's 3). They had to ask us to come take him home because he was beating up other kids and teachers.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; how does  a 3 year old take on multiple teachers and students and make them all fear him? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; your kid is pretty cool sounding already. I think we would get along.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he comes up to like my hip.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think its because I haven't been acting the dad lately due to phone stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he needs a dad's influence (yeah right . . .)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I made a little girl scared of me in preschool. I poured some sand in the rice bucket. I mean seriously, am I scary? lol</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I think my dad needs some kid influence. I have been on the compueter a lot...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the teacher told him "you don't bite the other teacher, you only bite food. like apples"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I might take a little break again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and he replies: "I also pushed the other teacher, and I hit jessie".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I don't think he got the concept ;-)</span><br />
