<span class="irc-date">[7:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I think the msdos binary supports the old 8.3 filename convention. vfat supports long filenames</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i'm pretty sure that's a mount-time decision.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not sure what you mean...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; long file names. i don't think how you make the fs has anything to do with it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; it's not how you make the filenames</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; both of them are symlinks to newfs_msdos</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; when you create the partition</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; screw the damn filenames. newfs_msdos os borked and we need a solution :-p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it is? i really doubt they use something broken just for kicks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; but when you mount it, depending on the type (vfat or msdos) dictates the capabilities because then it uses one of two different binaries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, well, I send newfs_msdos the command to format '/dev/block/vold/179:9' and it actually formats '/dev/block/vold/179:1' and borks '/dev/block/vold/179:9'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; So yeah, I'd say it's fucked actually...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yes, but that's also a *choice* you make when you mount it. afaik the only difference between a vfat and an ms-dos filesystem is that one has had long filenames stored in it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nothing about how you format it makes that choice for you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; yes, when you format it it's the same tool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; check it, both should just be symlinks to mkfs.msdos</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; *mkdosfs on ubuntu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok, mea culpa. newfs_msdos is fine, if I execute it manually it works. The vold daemon is at fault (again!)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: not that that means much, several dozen programs with clearly different behavior are all symlinks to busybox ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[8:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ...it's right there? ((ma)&lt;&lt;8|(mi)) ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; or does it just shift 'ma' by 8 bits and 'concatenate' it with 'mi'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, yes, I'm not blind :-p I can't quite remember what the '&lt;&lt;' and '|' in that expression mean, so I just wanted to make sure...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; &lt;&lt; is a left shift, | is a bitwise OR.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not 100%, but I think we might have to move our external SD to another place.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt;  /emmc seems to be handled differently and seems to screw stuff up...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; vold assigns /emmc the partition number -1, which of course is totally wrong...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Kaik541, could you please to a 'adb shell df -h' and tell me which device number you have mounted on '/mnt/emmc'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; that depends on what you mean by "partition number"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and i thought we want to mount it on /mnt/sdcard/external_sd? for the obvious reasons?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; well, the cards are named /dev/block/vold/X:*, where X is the device number and * is the partition number</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and vold thinks of /emmc and /sdcard as being the same device, /emmc being the device itself (thus it asigns it the partition number -1) and /sdcard being the first mountable partition, thus it gets the partition number 1 assigned to it</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; you can just copy them over via adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; using dd command</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; embizzle, ahhh dont have adb set up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; i had it on my hero, but not on the SGS</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; i had the sdk downloaded to my linux machine, and I was using it then</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; I could carry out basic tasks with adb on the hero, but dont really have the time to really get to understand it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; do you still have the sdk downloaded that you used for your hero?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I think it's the same</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I thought the sdk is for android, not per device</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; might look into that then...will have to refresh what little knowledge I had :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; how do you get the files onto your phone to flash them?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; doesn't ubuntu require it to run as root</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; which just entails adding the path to adb into your global path</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; and do I need to put the modem anywhere in particular on my linux machine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; actually you really ought to use flash_image radio /sdcard/modem.bin, i'd think? this will do things "right" by repeating any failed block writes on the next block</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; that information I gave was from codeworkx</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well I'm just saying I know ubuntu does specifically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; *groan*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; tell you what..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I didnt' inquire the logic, but I assume the issue is any unnecessary flash is risk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; before giving advice, decide between you how it should be done :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; that way it'll save confusing people who dont understand to begin with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ubuntu doesnt require adb to be run as root</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; and ubuntu doesn't do traditional nix root/user distinctions anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: i don't have any idea what you might mean by that, or why you would think dd isn't "flashing" the partition somehow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; flashing via odin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; flash is a flash, regardless of method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; if you say so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; fastboot is a flash</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I assume anything that has the ability to write to NAND is considered a flash</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; as I wrote earlier, what I wrote was from codeworkx. you two should probably ask him directly why he advised to use dd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I only added the additional information that the general consensus of odin is that it's an unreliable method to flash one's phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; so, what should I be doing then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: oh, i see, he was advising *not* to use odin. that makes sense, because rild is using mtd access (and will handle bad blocks by skipping them), and odin will use bml (a specific block-remapping strategy)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; well you should be familiar with adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; is sane advice, imo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also you should flash kernel images with odin/heimdall as they're read by the bootloader, which uses bml. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; mbizzle, well, I dont need to be if I can continue using the method i have been doing...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; though that doesn't matter if your boot partition has no bad blocks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; it's you guys that are pushing the benefits of adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; doesn't bother me either way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; Unhelpful I advised not to use odin. codeworkx specifically said to use dd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; for modem flashes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I didn't say anything about kernel flashes. I advise heimdall for that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; right, you said, but that doesn't make sense, because of how rild will handle bad blocks - the same way flash_image would.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; odin/heimdall can't be used to flash modems in general, you will have to use either dd or the flash_image method (which I think is just a complex version of dd)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; emphasis on the "I think" part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; Kaik541, CWM for modem flash!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; cwm uses the flash_image method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; yeah it looks like he was just saying you *can't* use odin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; which is what I've pretty much always done :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; mbizzle, to flash modems?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; the only thing odin can put into place is the kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mbizzle, do you still have my mod on your device?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; yes evaluate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mbizzle, can you afford to format the SD cards?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I prefer to use dd because it's less hassle. I didn't actually know you cant use odin to flash modems I've used it once i believe :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I can once I backup my data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; both cards?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Well, since vold is fucked up and might do nasty stuff, I'd say backup both of your SDs just to be sure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; or in the unlikely event your mod accidentally my sdcard?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; lol as I suspected</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ok I'll back them both up np</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; mikebeecham once you learn adb basics it's very seamless to work on the internals of your phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; for example, right now I just do "adb pull /sdcard/ ./sdcard" to back up my sdcard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; mbizzle, sure...but since no agreement seems to have been reached about to do the things I would use ADB for, I'll stick to what I know for now...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; not to say that I wouldn't pick it up later on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mbizzle, but tell me when you're finished with the backup, because there's one more thing that needs to be changed before trying the format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I don't really know how else to do backups like that other than adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I'm almost done, what do I need to change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; in /etc/vold.fstab, change the 'auto' in the emmc mount line to '9'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; and when you ran into that issue about finding you had to transfer a file over, you can actually do "adb shell mv /mnt/emmc/&lt;file&gt; /mnt/sdcard/" while you were in cmw and flash the file. no rebooting necessary, no fiddling with file managers to move the file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ok do I need to reboot?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; well, format will probably work, but it doesn't matter since the card won't be mounted properly anyway</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; No, there isn't any fstab like on normal linux machines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; where do we set mount options?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; you can't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; actually you can, but you have to edit the vold source code for that, since the mount options are hardcoded in there (I know, it sucks)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; but we can remount on the fly, but there's no file to put the mount options in?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; that's bizarre</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I should just be able to remount my partitions at boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; vold handles that automatically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: but we don't mount from an fstab at boot, because the gui is supposed to interact with vold so that it can report and let you modify volume state..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok I think I know what the solution may be, just not sure where I have to modify it. We need to tell vold that /sdcard and /emmc are separate devices, because it currently sees them as the same device (179)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; we would have to have /sdcard be 179:0 and /emmc be 180:0 or something like that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; oh looks like I can create a userinit.sh to modify things at bootup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I'm looking in /etc/init.d/*userinit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: um, do the numbers *mean* anything outside of vold, though?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not sure, I don't think so...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I mean, they clearly use the MAJOR device number in a lot of places, if it would mean anything they would've just hardcoded it, wouldn't they?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; So I guess they made it so that it could be modified in the future, the implementation sucks a lot though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: um, 179 is the device major number.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; you can't just decide to have it different. and same major number does *not* mean same actual device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; anything that assumes it does needs that assumption fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; But like I said, they didn't hardcode it, they use variables like mDeviceMajor to refer to it, that's why I'm saying that it's implemented so it can be modified...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ...vold doesn't decide what the major/minor numbers for devices are. their kernel drivers, and other facilities in the kernel, do that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, if it is the same major number, it is the same device. Because if you have a device with mountpoint 'auto', it defaults to -1, which means entire device. If you format that device, it formats the whole thing (that means the whole 179 device)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Believe me, I tested it and I know what I'm talking about.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; That's actually the problem why I can't format /emmc now, because it has been set as 'auto'. So when I try to format it, it formats the whole 179:*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; That means it also formats the internal SD, which is 179:1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; *sigh* i'm trying to explain that it is not vold that decides mmcblk0 and mmcblk1 have the same major number. and they have the same major number, and *are different devices*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the problem is not the numbers, its the assumption vold makes based on them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; These are virtual devices created *by* vold (in /dev/block/vold) so yes, the device numbers *are* actually handled by vold and vold only</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; did you try looking at /dev/block/mmcblk*? the *nodes* in /dev/block/vold are created by vold, but the numbers *do not* come from vold.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; The actual devices are indeed the mmcblk* devices you mentioned, but vold handles them internally by their virtual device names in /dev/block/vold.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ok brb I hope things dont asplode on me</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ... yes, and the major/minor numbers don't come from vold, and are assigned by the kernel. *all* of our mmc devices are major 179, and nothing you poke at in vold will change that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the devices it creates in /dev/block/vold are not some kind of "virtual" devices that go through vold somehow, they have the same type, major, and minor numbers as the regular mmc devices, and anything that opens them is talking to the mmc driver, not vold.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; hmm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I still don't get it why they're both on the 179 block</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; because majors are not unique per physical devices. they're generally unique per driver, although a driver that needs many device nodes can get several majors.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; as i said before, the broken-ness is not in both devices having the same major, but in the assumption that same major = same device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok that means that vold was programmed by an idiot then...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; And I also don't get why, if I set emmc to be minor '9', vold tries to mount 179:0</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mnita|work, well, I wanted the whole tree so I can have it all in one folder, like I have the teamhacksung repo now, so I can easily build an update/initial package with my changes if need be</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'd like to know if it's the same for the captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; because if they're the same on the captivate, we could set this in aries, couldn't we?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but I don't know if BOARD_xxx can be set in common</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we don't have BoardConfigs there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; crap.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; what does this do, what happens when we set it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; it get used in vold so that it can correctly identify the device that needs to be formatted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; so this might make that vold back unnecessary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; it has to be tested though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; without your changes to other stuff, and just setting this, will it break stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; No.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; because if there is any possibility that it breaks stuff, this needs to be in a branch until tested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; It is only used in the formatting function and only if you try to format the emmc, which, without my changes, you can't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I have to go now, will be back in a couple of hours.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Then I can test it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; right now it is present in htc inc</span><br />
