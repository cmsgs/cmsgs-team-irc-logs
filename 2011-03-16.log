<span class="irc-date">[7:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I think the msdos binary supports the old 8.3 filename convention. vfat supports long filenames</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i'm pretty sure that's a mount-time decision.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not sure what you mean...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; long file names. i don't think how you make the fs has anything to do with it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; it's not how you make the filenames</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; both of them are symlinks to newfs_msdos</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; when you create the partition</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; screw the damn filenames. newfs_msdos os borked and we need a solution :-p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it is? i really doubt they use something broken just for kicks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; but when you mount it, depending on the type (vfat or msdos) dictates the capabilities because then it uses one of two different binaries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, well, I send newfs_msdos the command to format '/dev/block/vold/179:9' and it actually formats '/dev/block/vold/179:1' and borks '/dev/block/vold/179:9'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; So yeah, I'd say it's fucked actually...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yes, but that's also a *choice* you make when you mount it. afaik the only difference between a vfat and an ms-dos filesystem is that one has had long filenames stored in it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nothing about how you format it makes that choice for you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; yes, when you format it it's the same tool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; check it, both should just be symlinks to mkfs.msdos</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; *mkdosfs on ubuntu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok, mea culpa. newfs_msdos is fine, if I execute it manually it works. The vold daemon is at fault (again!)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: not that that means much, several dozen programs with clearly different behavior are all symlinks to busybox ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[8:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ...it's right there? ((ma)&lt;&lt;8|(mi)) ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; or does it just shift 'ma' by 8 bits and 'concatenate' it with 'mi'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, yes, I'm not blind :-p I can't quite remember what the '&lt;&lt;' and '|' in that expression mean, so I just wanted to make sure...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; &lt;&lt; is a left shift, | is a bitwise OR.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not 100%, but I think we might have to move our external SD to another place.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt;  /emmc seems to be handled differently and seems to screw stuff up...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; vold assigns /emmc the partition number -1, which of course is totally wrong...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Kaik541, could you please to a 'adb shell df -h' and tell me which device number you have mounted on '/mnt/emmc'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; that depends on what you mean by "partition number"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and i thought we want to mount it on /mnt/sdcard/external_sd? for the obvious reasons?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; well, the cards are named /dev/block/vold/X:*, where X is the device number and * is the partition number</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and vold thinks of /emmc and /sdcard as being the same device, /emmc being the device itself (thus it asigns it the partition number -1) and /sdcard being the first mountable partition, thus it gets the partition number 1 assigned to it</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; you can just copy them over via adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; using dd command</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; embizzle, ahhh dont have adb set up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; i had it on my hero, but not on the SGS</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; i had the sdk downloaded to my linux machine, and I was using it then</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; I could carry out basic tasks with adb on the hero, but dont really have the time to really get to understand it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; do you still have the sdk downloaded that you used for your hero?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I think it's the same</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I thought the sdk is for android, not per device</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; might look into that then...will have to refresh what little knowledge I had :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; how do you get the files onto your phone to flash them?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; doesn't ubuntu require it to run as root</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; which just entails adding the path to adb into your global path</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; and do I need to put the modem anywhere in particular on my linux machine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; actually you really ought to use flash_image radio /sdcard/modem.bin, i'd think? this will do things "right" by repeating any failed block writes on the next block</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; that information I gave was from codeworkx</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well I'm just saying I know ubuntu does specifically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; *groan*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; tell you what..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I didnt' inquire the logic, but I assume the issue is any unnecessary flash is risk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; before giving advice, decide between you how it should be done :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; that way it'll save confusing people who dont understand to begin with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ubuntu doesnt require adb to be run as root</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; and ubuntu doesn't do traditional nix root/user distinctions anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: i don't have any idea what you might mean by that, or why you would think dd isn't "flashing" the partition somehow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; flashing via odin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; flash is a flash, regardless of method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; if you say so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; fastboot is a flash</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I assume anything that has the ability to write to NAND is considered a flash</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; as I wrote earlier, what I wrote was from codeworkx. you two should probably ask him directly why he advised to use dd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I only added the additional information that the general consensus of odin is that it's an unreliable method to flash one's phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; so, what should I be doing then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: oh, i see, he was advising *not* to use odin. that makes sense, because rild is using mtd access (and will handle bad blocks by skipping them), and odin will use bml (a specific block-remapping strategy)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; well you should be familiar with adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; is sane advice, imo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also you should flash kernel images with odin/heimdall as they're read by the bootloader, which uses bml. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; mbizzle, well, I dont need to be if I can continue using the method i have been doing...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; though that doesn't matter if your boot partition has no bad blocks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; it's you guys that are pushing the benefits of adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; doesn't bother me either way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; Unhelpful I advised not to use odin. codeworkx specifically said to use dd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; for modem flashes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I didn't say anything about kernel flashes. I advise heimdall for that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; right, you said, but that doesn't make sense, because of how rild will handle bad blocks - the same way flash_image would.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; odin/heimdall can't be used to flash modems in general, you will have to use either dd or the flash_image method (which I think is just a complex version of dd)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; emphasis on the "I think" part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; Kaik541, CWM for modem flash!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; cwm uses the flash_image method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; yeah it looks like he was just saying you *can't* use odin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; which is what I've pretty much always done :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; mbizzle, to flash modems?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; the only thing odin can put into place is the kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mbizzle, do you still have my mod on your device?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; yes evaluate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mbizzle, can you afford to format the SD cards?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I prefer to use dd because it's less hassle. I didn't actually know you cant use odin to flash modems I've used it once i believe :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I can once I backup my data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; both cards?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Well, since vold is fucked up and might do nasty stuff, I'd say backup both of your SDs just to be sure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; or in the unlikely event your mod accidentally my sdcard?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; lol as I suspected</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ok I'll back them both up np</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; mikebeecham once you learn adb basics it's very seamless to work on the internals of your phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; for example, right now I just do "adb pull /sdcard/ ./sdcard" to back up my sdcard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; mbizzle, sure...but since no agreement seems to have been reached about to do the things I would use ADB for, I'll stick to what I know for now...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; not to say that I wouldn't pick it up later on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mbizzle, but tell me when you're finished with the backup, because there's one more thing that needs to be changed before trying the format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I don't really know how else to do backups like that other than adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I'm almost done, what do I need to change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; in /etc/vold.fstab, change the 'auto' in the emmc mount line to '9'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; and when you ran into that issue about finding you had to transfer a file over, you can actually do "adb shell mv /mnt/emmc/&lt;file&gt; /mnt/sdcard/" while you were in cmw and flash the file. no rebooting necessary, no fiddling with file managers to move the file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ok do I need to reboot?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; well, format will probably work, but it doesn't matter since the card won't be mounted properly anyway</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; No, there isn't any fstab like on normal linux machines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; where do we set mount options?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; you can't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; actually you can, but you have to edit the vold source code for that, since the mount options are hardcoded in there (I know, it sucks)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; but we can remount on the fly, but there's no file to put the mount options in?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; that's bizarre</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I should just be able to remount my partitions at boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; vold handles that automatically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; mbizzle: but we don't mount from an fstab at boot, because the gui is supposed to interact with vold so that it can report and let you modify volume state..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok I think I know what the solution may be, just not sure where I have to modify it. We need to tell vold that /sdcard and /emmc are separate devices, because it currently sees them as the same device (179)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; we would have to have /sdcard be 179:0 and /emmc be 180:0 or something like that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; oh looks like I can create a userinit.sh to modify things at bootup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; I'm looking in /etc/init.d/*userinit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: um, do the numbers *mean* anything outside of vold, though?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not sure, I don't think so...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I mean, they clearly use the MAJOR device number in a lot of places, if it would mean anything they would've just hardcoded it, wouldn't they?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; So I guess they made it so that it could be modified in the future, the implementation sucks a lot though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: um, 179 is the device major number.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; you can't just decide to have it different. and same major number does *not* mean same actual device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; anything that assumes it does needs that assumption fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; But like I said, they didn't hardcode it, they use variables like mDeviceMajor to refer to it, that's why I'm saying that it's implemented so it can be modified...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ...vold doesn't decide what the major/minor numbers for devices are. their kernel drivers, and other facilities in the kernel, do that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, if it is the same major number, it is the same device. Because if you have a device with mountpoint 'auto', it defaults to -1, which means entire device. If you format that device, it formats the whole thing (that means the whole 179 device)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Believe me, I tested it and I know what I'm talking about.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; That's actually the problem why I can't format /emmc now, because it has been set as 'auto'. So when I try to format it, it formats the whole 179:*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; That means it also formats the internal SD, which is 179:1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; *sigh* i'm trying to explain that it is not vold that decides mmcblk0 and mmcblk1 have the same major number. and they have the same major number, and *are different devices*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the problem is not the numbers, its the assumption vold makes based on them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; These are virtual devices created *by* vold (in /dev/block/vold) so yes, the device numbers *are* actually handled by vold and vold only</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; did you try looking at /dev/block/mmcblk*? the *nodes* in /dev/block/vold are created by vold, but the numbers *do not* come from vold.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; The actual devices are indeed the mmcblk* devices you mentioned, but vold handles them internally by their virtual device names in /dev/block/vold.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mbizzle&gt; ok brb I hope things dont asplode on me</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ... yes, and the major/minor numbers don't come from vold, and are assigned by the kernel. *all* of our mmc devices are major 179, and nothing you poke at in vold will change that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the devices it creates in /dev/block/vold are not some kind of "virtual" devices that go through vold somehow, they have the same type, major, and minor numbers as the regular mmc devices, and anything that opens them is talking to the mmc driver, not vold.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; hmm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I still don't get it why they're both on the 179 block</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; because majors are not unique per physical devices. they're generally unique per driver, although a driver that needs many device nodes can get several majors.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; as i said before, the broken-ness is not in both devices having the same major, but in the assumption that same major = same device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok that means that vold was programmed by an idiot then...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; And I also don't get why, if I set emmc to be minor '9', vold tries to mount 179:0</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mnita|work, well, I wanted the whole tree so I can have it all in one folder, like I have the teamhacksung repo now, so I can easily build an update/initial package with my changes if need be</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ] &lt;techmik67&gt; i dont know if this is progress or not.... i am using evaluates changes, and....... under settings&gt;storage it shows, in order,:   sdcard  13.03 total, and unmount sdcard and erase sdcard are both white, not grey, signifying they can be clicked......... then internal storage total space 1.85gb, ..... then removeable storage /mnt/emmc  14.83gb (its a 16gb card) and it now HAS the unmount sdcard and erase sdcard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; options, but they</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; [14:34] &lt;techmik67&gt; ARE NOT white</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; [14:35] &lt;techmik67&gt; also</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; [14:35] &lt;techmik67&gt; i can see both "cards" in/thru adb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; [14:36] &lt;techmik67&gt; aadb shell, then cd sdcard or cd emms i can ls each one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; mersault: confirm this for me please. it will be really painful if i896 doesn't have the A1026 chip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; mnita|work: I know, hence why I was trying to figure out, heh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; will need to create a new device</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;designfears&gt; &lt;mersault&gt; yeah, that's the wiki page I was looking at</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; any ideas on how to probe the hardware from adb shell to figure it out?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; hmmm.... if we take the Rogers stock ROM, root it for adb use, and then dmesg, would it appear there?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; hmm... my buddy might have his I896 still running on the version of cognition that was based on the Rogers stock rom</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; the 3.x series was rogers jl1 based, I believe.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; the code looks like it doesn't have it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; all the audience code from the captivate is missing in the i896</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; from the i897 is missing from the i896</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but that doesn't mean anything . . . captivate source drop didn't have A1026 code either when it first dropped while vibrant did :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; yeah, I'd like to probe an I896</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; unhelpful! coolya!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we're cat'ing default.prop and build.prop into default.prop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and I guess that line is meant for phones that have separate recovery and real images</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but we're basically duplicating all the stuff in build.prop in default.prop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and that  is what is screwing up lcd_density for example</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; because changing build.prop does nothing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; that file is basically unused - default.prop stuff is taking precedence</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; AHA! I've been wondering why changes to build.prop haven't been taking effect!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; perhaps we should just add the model-related properties?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I'm just going to split them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; sec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; do we even need a default.prop?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; it seems /system does exist in recovery, so we could just leave it as /system/build.prop and /default.prop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful would like the model ID stuff in because then updates will still install after wiping /system</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; I'd love for it to be easy for us I896 owners to be able to set our phones to be I896 :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; there is already a TARGET_ROOT_IS_RECOVERY</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; the configure error happens on i897 too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and the firmware download error :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; mnita|work: this one is grepped better: <a href="http://pastebin.com/pp8RXSwX">http://pastebin.com/pp8RXSwX</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; the device not supported is new tho - so I guess you don't have it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but the driver just fails - so the code does try it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and we can ignore it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; do i9000 modems work well for you?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; yup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; do i897?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; modems?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; on stock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; I honestly forget...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; should try that - that'll tell you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; jl1 is what kind of modem?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; if you can run an i897 modem on stock, then you have the audience chip working.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; that's what Rogers released</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I don't know JL2 and 3 are i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but dunno about jl1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; so if my friend flashes a KB1 modem and it sounds good....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; it should sound like utter crap</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; if the chip isn't there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; where is Kaik541 when I need him.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; yeah, but he has an i897</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; will the kb1 modem zip included in the cm7 stuff work on my friends ROM?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; the modem zips are all the same, correct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yes, but he knows this sort of stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; he knows how to use CWM, yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; differences between phones, models etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; oh, kaik, right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I mean Kaik541. Your friend has i897?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; that doesn't work :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; no, my friend has an i896</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ok, then ask him to try kb1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; see if it sounds like crap</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zerojay_work&gt; I'm on the Rogers captivate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; on stock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zerojay_work&gt; Oh, nm.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; has to be stock froyo :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but it is looking like rogers captivate doesn't have the audience chip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; at least from the driver</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; so, what's the scoop on the defaul.prop vs. build.prop?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; working on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; can I delete one of them, edit one of them, etc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; dunno, you could try deleting build.prop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; default.prop comes from the kernel ramdisk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so you basically can't edit it :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; needs a different defconfig then if I enable A1026</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; from my understanding, it's because there was nothing in the source code about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I haven't personally checked, I've just heard it from a number of people</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; well yeah, I saw that. but the first captivate eclair drop didn't have it either ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I suppose it could though, as their modems don't have voice processing either (so it would make sense if they did)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we got it off the vibrant source drop :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ok, only way to test is to go to stock on rogers, and try kb1 or something captivate specific</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; hmmm, my friend is getting an assert failed when trying to flash KB1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I know for a fact that they can use the same modems we do</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; mnita|work: yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and we can use their modems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; the zip will have the device prop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; ah, so I gotta rip out the actual file and build another zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; someone needs to unzip it, modify the updater-script (or update-script) to take out the device check and rezip, sign.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok, different than yesterday, but still not quite right........ i mounted and unmounted externalcard, and that seemed to go ok, but when i told it to erase the removeable card, it looked like it was, then when remounted showed the same as before...... but when i went to file manager or root explorer, external is untouched, but internal is semi-formatted......  all folders gone, but the files that were in the root of the sdcard</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; sure</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; all i did was back up, then format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok, it still didn't get formatted. Do you press format when the card is unmounted?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; not this time.... 1st time i did it both mounted and unmounted (yesterday)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok, could you please try that too?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ok, there's something wrong with your system. I guess you have a wrong vold</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'll give you the proper vold binary in a second</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; unpack that and push it to /system/bin/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Then do a 'adb shell killall vold' and then try again to format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and paste the logcat :-p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; btw, after doing 'adb shell killall vold' both of your cards will get unmounted, that is normal.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; funny, some guy tweeted both me and DG to tell us he's running the most recently nightly..</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; maybe DG is finally taking stuff from teamhacksung ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; yeah, probably because your so like bff and shit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yeah. he's definitely my favorite kanger in the world.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; later!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; what is the source of the term 'kanger'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; mersault: The explanation I got is that 'kang' has its root in a phonetic reversal of 'gank', and 'kanger' is 'one who kangs'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Gank is a slang term for steal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok, both unmouted after killall... mount em and format?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; UberPinguin: thanks. good enough.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; though, where is gank slang?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; The US</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; gank is common in video games</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; usually when you get ambused it's referred to as 'being ganked"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; I knew some wannabe gangbangers in high school who used it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but apparently gank is also a real word which means "to steal"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gank#Verb">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gank#Verb</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; example 4 kinda makes me laugh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; TIL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; progress.... it worked and wiped external</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; cant unmount internal now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; is there any error in logcat?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[23:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; where was it approximately?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; near the end</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; wait</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; sec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; When building for a Coretex A8 w/ Neon target, is 'armv7a-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi' a valid tuple?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; around 19:01?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; now it unmounted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; and remounted itself?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; unmount in progress</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; then it stops</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; but it still mounted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, the reason it didn't unmount before (from what I can tell) is because there is an app that is accessing the sdcard that it can't kill.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and since it can't kill that app, it can't unmount...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, I have to go to sleep now because it 1AM here already and I have to go to work tomorrow. If you have the time and patience please do a couple more test and tell me what exactly is and what isn't working. (I actually tested both unmounting and formatting and both seemed to work fine for me...)</span><br />
