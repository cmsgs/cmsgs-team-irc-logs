<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; hell I've gotten tracking numbers sent to me after the package already arrived</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the product is generally nice. not really their fault that they sold me something right before it was discovered it would need RMA'd. but, um, customer service could be better. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, service from my reseller has been very good. but he's not running the RMA. clearly sager makes it easy to be a *very* light reseller... i suspect you just pass orders on to them, and are only responsible for sales and bumping customer svc stuff over to them.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; they might work now</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; would that be alright?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so the interferon is what, for keeping the hep c from making a comeback?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yes, interferon is fighting the virus</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; since I am not cured of the hep C</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; but interferon can keep it to undetectable levels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; atinm|night: how'd you end up with hep, if you don't mind my asking?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so it isn't hurting the liver, but I have to stay on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; blood transfusion as a child before there were tests for hep c</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; aww :&lt; sorry to hear that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Were you in an accident or something?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; surgery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; to fix my nose after I broke it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so yeah - accident I guess</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Oh, that's super scary, I'm glad that didn't happen to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; since I bled a lot and had to get transfusion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so the interferon fights the hep c</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; but causes bone marrow suppression</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; which causes low white cells and platelets</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so I get another shot in combination</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; on thursday and monday morning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; that boosts the bone marrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and its side-effects are body ache and bone pain</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I didn't even know bones could hurt before this..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; lemme guess, neupogen? or something like it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; neupogen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; shots thursday night and monday morning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; interferon shots thursday night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; how do you know neupogen?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I was also on the other one for red count, but that is done now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; forget the name</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; father had it when he had cancer, his chemo had his white counts down.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I figured..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; sorry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; huh? he still exists, he *had* cancer, and he *had* neupogen... but those are both not part of his life any more. so far. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; interferon is considered something like the chemo in its effects - but I think it isn't as bad</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; oh, awesome. I figured he was on it still or well, lost.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; when you said "had", first assumption in relation to cancer is the worst kind.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I'm glad :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; FDA approved the new drugs for Hep C.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yesterday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; woot woot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; that will cure a lot of people - something like 80%</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yay.... what do they do? will they get you off of anything you're on now, or on less of it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; but I can't get it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; atinm|night: are you on autoimmune suppresants too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; since it reacts very badly with immuno-suppressants</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so non-transplant it is great for</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; transplant, not so much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so I have to keep waiting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; it also has bad resistance characteristics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; if you are in the 20% that aren't cure, the HCV is more resistant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; not something an immuno-suppressed patient can do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; there are other drugs that are very good in the pipeline, but about 2 years out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; tho my doctors are trying to get the drug companies to set up trials with transplant patients</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; since they're already behind by 2 years and need a foothold</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and transplant population is it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; hep c is the largest cause for liver transplants now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so my docs want me on it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and since all trials do involve them (Harvard . . .)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I should be on them if they succeed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so that's what I'm hoping for right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; in the meantime, at least the virus is suppressed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; just have to deal with bad side-effects</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so anyway - hurting badly now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so going to bed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; someone with iphone toting friends, sync, build and test MMS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; that 3gs should be good atinm|night?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; anything iphone I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I know iphone4 - but they all have basically the same software</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; and I'll mms my iphone4 toting cousin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so most probably any</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; well, it is more that he has to mms you :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;h8rift&gt; curious, what was the symptom? could receive mms but it would not de-crypt the media sent on the receiving handset?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; I also need someone to build a kernel for me with one minor change, any takers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; I need anyone with a gsm sgs device, doesn't matter which</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; erm, the kernel is *such* a small piece of build time :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; h8rift: right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;h8rift&gt; k. what was the proposed fix?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;h8rift&gt; im curious bc on my ATrix, on stock 2.2.2, it does the same thing with iPhone users</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;h8rift&gt; like, identical.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;h8rift&gt; im curious if i can use the same fix, assuming this fixes it for the SGS</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; the only thing I think could have been the cause is that RM asked me if I wanted to wipe dalvik</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; excellent.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; koush__: you saw I put our vendor tree up under vendor/samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; in proprietary_vendor_samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and so now we have to use the local_manifest.xml - and I just tested that and it works.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; last question for you - for now. How does ROMManager know that there is an update available?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; when I upload a new package, I need to do something so ROMManager knows this updates a previous one?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; koush__: like version number would be higher - or does it check the ro.modversion I enter on the page?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; mnita|work: did you upload the wrong update to i9000mtd?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; mnita|work: yes, you need to follow the instructions on my blog</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; mnita|work: and captivate too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; mnita|work, custom kernels are affected, too like I wrote :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; you define a product, and set your modversion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; mnita|work: &lt;sixstringsg&gt; codeworkx: it wiped my entire data as well. When I went to where it downloads the files, it said initial.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; and set a developerid</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; mnita|work: wheres your vendor/cyanogen repo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; link please</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; and give me acces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; meh, just merge with CM :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; that'll make it work too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; sec.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; added</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; mnita|work: you're a owner</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; how did you add him?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; whats the status on that big build merge?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; Owners have full access to all repositories and have admin rights to the organization.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I am on the organization members page, but don't see how to change anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ah found it :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; sorry, koush__ waiting on Unhelpful still</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I was cleaning up other stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; will look at the Makefile next.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; now vendor tree is clean, I think Makefile is the last big thing left.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so that's next on my list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; tho Unhelpful also has a build machine now - just very slow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; his laptop is on te way back, i think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; great, so maybe another day or so before we send something up for review</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; then the whole kitnkaboodle.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; 1st, cleanup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; there are a bunch of unused branches xD</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yes yes - I'll only upload the gingerbread branches.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; that's all that'll go in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we need to talk about releasetools - not sure how that fits in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but not right now - work calls.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; back later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; koush__: how do we send up new repositories?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; they go thru gerrit as well?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; like our device stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; our kernel tree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; mnita|work: i'll fork them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt;  and add to gerrit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ah, ok.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; what changed in release tools</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; is that how you added teh bml convert?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; koush__: dont' know - codeworkx is the expert there, but the bml convert magic is there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; ok yeah i brought this up the other day</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; i wont accept those changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; cause thats gonna be a merge nightmare in the future</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; what you need to do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; is make the changes in squisher/bacon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; which is pure cm repo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; koush_: our releasetools are only for initial (convert). they've nothing to do with buildsystem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; releasetools is in build/tools/releasetools right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; no</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; oh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; you modified the ota script gen how then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; sorry - my mistake then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I'll keep shut and listen for a bit :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; <a href="https://github.com/teamhacksung/releasetools">https://github.com/teamhacksung/releasetools</a> is not part of the buildsystem. we're using it to generate initial.zips after building android</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; codeworkx: ok i see</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; codeworkx: i would move that into bacon :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; bacon is the CM post processor</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; is there a example on any device i can kang?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; do you guys run make -j4 bacon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; or make otapackage?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; brunch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; brunch?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; . build/envsetup.sh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; brunch galaxys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; ok yes that does a bacon build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; ok to give you background</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:05]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* Wout` (~Wout@s559776f4.adsl.wanadoo.nl) Quit ()</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; make otapackage makes an AOSP zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; make bacon makes a CM zip, which builds on top of the AOSP zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; basically, unzips the aosp zip, and repacks it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; it does a ton of shit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; like png crush</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; signs shit properly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; you can find it in the vendor/cyanogen/prebuilt/squisher</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; what you are doing right now is a post zip build step right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yes, to build our initial conversion zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; only that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; what modifes your updater-script?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; nightly update is just brunch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; cause that has some special shit in it too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; koush_: the initial updater-script is a static file which is used</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; only for initial, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; confused now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; let me download your zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; koush_: start here: <a href="https://github.com/teamhacksung/releasetools/blob/gingerbread/universal.sh#L30">https://github.com/teamhacksung/releasetools/blob/gingerbread/universal.sh#L30</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; remember, this is only the zip that does conversion from bml to mtd etc. once you're on CM7, it is just using the output of brunch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; it's just a dirty script which grabs some files from out/target/product/xxxx/ and creates a flashable zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; do you only have 1 initial zip?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; and then subserquent updates dont have that bootstrap?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; ohh ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; i thought every version had it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; our "normal" updates are as normal as possile</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we just upload it anyway - so that first conversion is always to the latest.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; thats good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; koush_: only thing is flash_image. that's replaced by bml_over_mtd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; well what we can do is always make sure stable releases have that bootstrap zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; koush_: <a href="https://github.com/teamhacksung/android_device_samsung_galaxys/blob/gingerbread/releasetools/galaxys_ota_from_target_files#L106">https://github.com/teamhacksung/android_device_samsung_galaxys/blob/gingerbread/releasetools/galaxys_ota_from_target_files#L106</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; kanged from a other cm7 device and modified</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; encore?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; gotcha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; yes it was from encore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; where do these hacked scripts etc go in CyanogenMod?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; do they go at all?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; just another repo that hangs out there?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; thinks that are not part of the usual build process like our initial conversion stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; *things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; guess we could rename our repo to sgs_initial_releasetools and have that forked into CM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; well theirs is in the device/bn/encore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; and they override the script</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; BoardConfig.mk:TARGET_RELEASETOOL_OTA_FROM_TARGET_SCRIPT := ./device/bn/encore/releasetools/encore_ota_from_target_files</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; so it gets automatically used by the build system</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; let's not worry about that for now though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; lets get the bare minimum merged</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; ie, you can build an ota off buildbot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; so, from what i understand, the only outstanding change is just in build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; koush_: you mean this one <a href="https://github.com/teamhacksung/android_device_samsung_galaxys/blob/gingerbread/BoardConfig.mk#L45">https://github.com/teamhacksung/android_device_samsung_galaxys/blob/gingerbread/BoardConfig.mk#L45</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; oh ok gotcha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; outstanding build changes, device folders, add devices to vendor/cyanogen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yes, I think only outstanding thing is build/core/Makefile</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; that's needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; nothing else</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; then it is forking and gerrit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; for all the devices, merging vendor/cyanogen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; what codeworkx said :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I figured vendor/cyanogen happens at the end</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; don't fork yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we need to clean the branches out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; the unused branches</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; will do the cleaning tonight when I'm home</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; hopefully Unhelpful will also be working on Makefile</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we had to learn gerrit for CM :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; 4-5 of us. koush__ can you add GuiPer to the proprietary_vendor_samsung repo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; mnita|work: sure</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; no matter what anyone says, *never* let me have direct access to anything....... I break stuff =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; GuiPerPT is his github nick - guiper is someone else</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; techmik: lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; koush__: one question from me about RIL, actually we are using crespo closed bits, what gives us some problems on the vibrant and simtoolkit is not working right with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; koush__: we don't want to give guiper access ;) -- he gets access to our repos all the time.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and we always have to remove him and add guiperpt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I'm gone.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i like pull requests so someone who knows what they are doing can prevent me form killing stuff for everyone =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; thats why I send my stuff to you first, two layers of protection</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; if i cant break it, its awesome code =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; koush__: the big problem is samsung hacked shit in the close parts of the aries phones, and changed some call backs and function prototypes in libril, what makes the dynamic linker fail to link aginst libsec-ril from aries phones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; speaking of protection, did you ever get your git working? I need to get some more sound testers :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; i can get it working but it need to fix the samsung fails in the framework :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; i tries working around breaking other devices by doing some changes to the ril and the phonefactory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; brb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; is there any chance that something like that would be accepted?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; my current wip is in <a href="https://github.com/coolya/android_frameworks_base/tree/crap-RIL">https://github.com/coolya/android_frameworks_base/tree/crap-RIL</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; the rest sort of follow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; basically we're hacking it to load our libril.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; if the property is set.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; the main problem is we can't do it in libril that is build form source because we are missing the relevant function prototype ril headers. The only way to work with the samsung stuff is the combination of libril and libsec-ril from samsung</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; tho maybe this isn't fair because the other phones also have families I think</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; sheesh, I have never seen so much in-fighting as I have on the cdma sgs devices</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; half our community is exploding over a fucking gingerbread leak</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; because a group got exclusive access to a leak, and even they started fighting amongst themselves over it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I've noticed that about the epic guys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; didn't this happen with the froyo leak too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nullghost: we dealt w/ that shit when there were gingerbread leaks, and certain persons releasing haxed GB leak ROMs like to talk about how bland and vanilla CM is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; yeah we had the same BS happen with our froyo beta leaks, it's pathetic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; ah good ol *REDACTED* wonder waht he's ben up to</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nullghost, in joke for someone we don't mention anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; a captivate dev who was a bit too full of himself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; ah &gt;.&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; "dev"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; basically... he got a hold of a froyo leak for captivate at one point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and apparently he had it for a day or so I guess, and all I said was "wow, if he doesn't share that, he's kind of a dick"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and he like flipped out and dragged it onto xda (I said it in a private channel on IRC)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and then I was like "conditional if statements must be lost on you" and then he tried reporting me to the xda mod's</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and then he deleted all the rude stuff he asid from his posts on xda so he wouldn't get in trouble haha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; fun times</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; that's awesome.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's ok though, he dropped his phone in a toilet or something similarly retarded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so we don't have to deal with him anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; basically what happened here is we have a group of devs who work together, and in general they're real nice and real supportive of the community as a whole</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; but their "fearless leader" is a guy with 0 dev skills and a non-existant temper fuse</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; this is on epic?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we used to have an epic dev around here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; they got a gingerbread leak, and wanted to make sure there was no way it could be traced back to their source before releasing it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; h ehas dev skills. he can cut and paste with the best of em</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I give up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; mnita|work: noobnl? he's ok.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; TMC_Sherpa, typing am hard, I know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; don't konw what happened to him</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; that's a whole other story</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we'd given up on epic as disfunctional ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and fascinate too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; so our roms are labeled in a year-month-day fashion, where the year and month are a single char</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; so the may 3rd build is EE03, you get the idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; ours are similar KB1 = 2011 for k, february, for b, 1 = first build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; exactly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; so the first build was ED12, and it was horribly broken, 4g and wimax didn't work, the battery sensor was broken, and many other issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; they got hold of ee03, which is a ton better, it's actually not far from being a stable gingerbread</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; sprint had .rdf files on their server which are used in mms parsing. they're super easy to find, and an easy way to see what builds sprint is testing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; they thought they found an ee12.rdf, so they released ee03 since it wasn't a brand new leak</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; turns out it was ed12, and their leak source almost lost his job (supposedly, but I have no idea how or why)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; their fearless leader flipped his shit, kicked out their best dev, and spread rumors that he left of his own free will</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; and this all happened today. yay dramaz.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; wow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; the noobnl thing is another story. he just got fed up with the community and decided to focus more on school.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; school == good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; I can't deal with noobnl though, he comes off as very arrogant to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; at least the captivate "dev" teams are just like "this is basically the stock rom with a nice theme"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nullghost, yes, yes he does</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and he doesn't always like to share it seemed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; but kid was a pain.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but he does like to show off</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so no big loss.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; anyway - back later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; it's made worse by his fail english, which is funny because he's born and raised in the states</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; none of us building your stuff for the epic claim to be great, we're just doing what we can in hopes of getting merged with you guys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; the only nice thing I can straight up say about noobnl is he's what encouraged the founding of CMSGSTeam</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; but noobnl made it seem like his CM6 build was so awesome, when it was quite hacky</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I freaked out about how epic was going to get CM6.1 before us GSM users and thanks to atinm and codeworkx a team managed to form</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; the worst part is he still comes around our irc and acts like he's still involved with CM, and tries to tell us what we should do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nullghost, wesgarner was sorta similar at first for GSM too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; I kid you not, he came into our irc and was like, "you guys should try to build ns4g kernel"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he was never a bad guy, and was helpful when he could be... but a lot of people still thought he was heavily involved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but then he disappeared for like a month to train for his new job</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; Duun Dun Duuun Duun Duun Duun... the a-team theme just doesn't come across well in text</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; haha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; the team effort is actually what happened with us epic users</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; TMC_Sherpa, you know what theme does? na na na na na na nana nana na na na na nana</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; we weren't satisfied with noobnl's builds and lack of effort, so we got together</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well we're glad someone took up epic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and really hope you guys can merge with us</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[23:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; those are included in the official zip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful, no, they just have to be pulled from the phones if someone wants to build manually</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[23:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; ok, Unhelpful so i can fork your device/samsung/* and build off cm now?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; the second I think is deprecated?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; Unhelpful: probably for your vendors</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the second of those is deprecated, the first is the one you need</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; Unhelpful: there still seems to bve a lot of diffs in your android/build vs ours</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; from what i am seeing, we have forks for vendor/cyanogen, our devices, our vendor, our kernel (but CM doesn't keep those in the tree), and a set of buildscripts and a releasetools dir that i don't think are actually needed for build.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yes, but i was able to build w/ the one just checked in for us, on a plain CM android/build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; my last little complaint... can we rename the vendors to device/samsung/captivatemtd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and vibrantmtd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; cm already has forks with those names, that are for the non-mtd versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and rm has scripts that use the device names to do publishing of recoveries and shit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; in fact, i can probably do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[23:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; let me give it a shot</span><br />
