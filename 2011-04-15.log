<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok, so i completed the make in the honeycomb snapshot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; no what do i do with it? =P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; now*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; wow, neon has some appallingly sexy instructions that i'm sure can't *possibly* be fully utilized by an autovectorizer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also BoschYamaha.cpp *alone* takes 10s to compile now ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i have a crazy thought......</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; just install it to /system/lib/hw, reboot, and grab logcat while you use something that uses compass. i'd suggest adb logcat &gt;file because my last attempt softbooted the phone, and i don't know if that'll wipe the log, and i don't want anything important to get pushed out. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; you'll probably need to turn the phone around some for it to get a good idea of the bias. assuming it doesn't softboot on first trying to calculate the bias. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if it does crash or softboot, you may want to install a stock sensors.aries.so so that you can safely use, say, maps. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; while rebooting, what do you think would happen if i dropped in the honeycomb camera apk?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, i believe BiasModel and BoschYamaha are both dumping pretty much all they do.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[4:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i dont know code... that was my 1st 2 ifndef statements =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; did you lnk the file you want me to test? or i usse the same link?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; use*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; same link, i've been re-uploading it to test on mine until i got to something i can't debuge w/ aLogcat :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; rebooting... i figured =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; its the changes to CecCameraHWInterface.cpp that have to be it</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[4:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i tihnk you may have done it, sir!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, you can turn it around and it points the right way?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ...and it didn't softboot on you? ;/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i held it portrait, N was pointing at me... as i rotated phone, arrow kept coming back to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; still going strong =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i kind of wanted a log on the crash that happened on mine ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but it consistently tells you north is in the same direction when you turn it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i'll test by walking arond a litlle, here, instead of just rotating... sec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:57]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful has never understood what the "figure-eight" calibration instructions were asking users to do - just move the phone in a figure-eight without rotating it? wtf will that do? afaict you must turn it about some to determine the sensor bias.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; it told me to calibrate =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i walked from my desk, around the corner and down the hall to bedroom, turned into bathroom, came back</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; still pointing at me, whgich i do believe is north =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[4:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; which*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; its twitching</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; just sitting on my desk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; but comes back to N every time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; like, by a large amount, or only a bit?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; very small</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i can add some smoothing. ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; excellent work!!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i wish we had at least another tester</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Unhelpful: let me know if you want me to test as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; he on vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it was built for captivate, but i don't *think* anything is changed per-target in libsensors?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lets find out =) can always just reflash latest update if a problem occurs =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; chaembian_: if you are reasonably comfortable w/ this sort of thing, you can just download <a href="http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/sensors.aries.so">http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/sensors.aries.so</a> , push it to /system/lib/hw/ , and then reboot. and maybe do a little dance if it works.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; oh! i know one thing that is probably different, the orientation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i better make a vibrant build. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; good catch =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; chaembian_: don't touch that for now, it'll probably screw everything orientation-related for you ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Unhelpful: Sure, whenever you want me to test, I can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; chaembian_: try <a href="http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/vibrant-sensors.aries.so">http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/vibrant-sensors.aries.so</a> and push it to /system/lib/hw/sensors.aries.so</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; chaembian_: that looks right, yes :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if you have a real compass, testing against it would be nice. it may be that you find your phone says north is consistently the same place, but gives the wrong direction for it. it may also have the rotation backwards depending on which sensor orientation you actually have.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; There is one, but I have never tested if it works. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; LOL!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, if it thinks your sensor is on entirely the wrong side of the board, that should be fairly easy to detect. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; hmmm... where is compass? :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i use sensor test apps m'self. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; google night sky is the *big* one for determining if your orientation is *really* good ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Used the compass in GPS Test</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; sensor test app, this: <a href="http://uk.androlib.com/android.application.ctsr-android-sensortest-qxpE.aspx">http://uk.androlib.com/android.application.ctsr-android-sensortest-qxpE.aspx</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; sky uses the full orientation data to show the part of the sky behind your phone. if orientation is screwed it's *very* easy to see. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; ok,will insatll night sky now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; google sky map, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ah, yeah, that's the name :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; might be hard to *fully* verify if it's day, of course. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; or cloudy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; i just realized the verification you are talking about</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; aargh! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; comparing to a real compass might be easier ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; i have real compass, no android compass to compare it with ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, sky map *does* have north/south/east/west labels along the horizon, and also zenith/nadir ones if you point your phone at the sky or ground. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; techmik67: so not fair, mine clearly still doesn't work right. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i just took it on a dog walk too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; it points N... a little smoother wouldnt hurt, got a little jitter, but it seems to be working well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so N is N for you?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; NE is N for me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; great. i just need to finish the quaternion orientation code - i can smooth the final orientation value once i'm calculating it as a quaternion.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I have went around the house and the readings have been consistent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; chaembian_: interesting. might be your compass isn't quite right, or it might not be getting the bias quite right. NE should not be N even if you have a different compass mount orientation than the phone thinks you have.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; well, at least very close... i dont have a real compass to test with, just the app, but if i turn towards the ocean, 1 mile to the east of me, it points left.... =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; (I have compared this with a battered, or should I say battle hardened, national geographic "key ring" compass)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; There is a better build somewhere hiding in the house. Let me look out for it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; "NE should not be N even if you have a different compass mount orientation than the phone thinks you .." -- I did not get this part though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; chaembian_: the sensor can be mounted in a different position on the board. there are 8 supported orientations in the driver, for mount on each side of the board, with each side of the sensor package facing the top of the device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; there is a position parameter you can set to tell the kernel the correct position to use, and it will rotate the sensor reading accordingly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if N was W, S, or E, this parameter being incorrect would explain it. if it's NE, either the reading is simply still wrong, your compass is wrong, or t-mo and samsung are bastards and mounted the sensor at an angle just to make me cry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i can't fully rule out the last possibility, but since most of these things come in rectangular packages, it would be very stupid to mount one of them crooked.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; When the actual compass is pointing to N, Vibrant kept parallely has N at +45 roughly</span><br />
