<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok, so i completed the make in the honeycomb snapshot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; no what do i do with it? =P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; now*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; wow, neon has some appallingly sexy instructions that i'm sure can't *possibly* be fully utilized by an autovectorizer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also BoschYamaha.cpp *alone* takes 10s to compile now ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; somebody wanna test <a href="http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/sensors.aries.so">http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/sensors.aries.so</a> ? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i have a crazy thought......</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; just install it to /system/lib/hw, reboot, and grab logcat while you use something that uses compass. i'd suggest adb logcat &gt;file because my last attempt softbooted the phone, and i don't know if that'll wipe the log, and i don't want anything important to get pushed out. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; you'll probably need to turn the phone around some for it to get a good idea of the bias. assuming it doesn't softboot on first trying to calculate the bias. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if it does crash or softboot, you may want to install a stock sensors.aries.so so that you can safely use, say, maps. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; while rebooting, what do you think would happen if i dropped in the honeycomb camera apk?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; MADNESS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol, k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i don't know, mixing components is generally not clever.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;polyrhythmic&gt; yeah camera rarely works between major versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; did not crash</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; compass</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yay!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; dump logs? you can grep out just lines w/ BoschYamaha or BiasModel in them. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok, got my 703k log =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, i believe BiasModel and BoschYamaha are both dumping pretty much all they do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok, i have log.txt, 4706 lines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; is that 703K *with* all the other junk?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i se some bosch yamaha stuff righ off....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; oh, i'm at the end of the file =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; heh. i could do this myself if i could view/filter logs on-device</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; no adb here :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ouch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10818379/log.txt">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10818379/log.txt</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; bluh, it never got enough to do anything, wonder why...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; our camera.apk is 3mb, honeycomb 334k???</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i figure 8 a few times, turned on compass apk, rotated a few times, closed compass, opened maps</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, something isn't right ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; didnt crash tho =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; still booted =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; hmmm... what about drivers and such?i have hardware/broadcom, qcom, ril.....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; and device/samsung/crespo</span><br />
