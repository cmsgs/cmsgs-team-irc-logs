<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so what are ppl talking about with "ghosting"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; it really depends: if they're somewhat experienced - they'll now that things are going on in the background</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since the new color temp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; but when they're younger - they'll probably pull the battery out or press the power button for a long time :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; just write in the howto - that it takes some time - no one's gonna read it anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; but if all else fails -&gt; it's in the howto ^^</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's funny seeing all these people complaining about not seeing CM on ROM manager... they don't have premium versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; *sigh*</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; like awesome</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no more writing changelogs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I am so happy!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; so just out of curiosity, the number (like 6, 9, etc) is just a numbering scheme that always increases?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; FOREVA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; No audience for you :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so nice to build on a real system again :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; As opposed to a fake system?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; as opposed to a pitiful one!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; got my sandy bridge back :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Oh nice.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; from core duo 2.16GHz -&gt; SB i7-2720QM 2.2GHz :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; I want to build a new machine. Get a i7 2600 and like 12gb of ram</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; although, since the iX models and turboboost, clock speeds mean pretty much nothing at all since various places will report max TB speed, max non-TB speed, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i appear to be doing about 2.7GHz @ present, i believe that's the max TB speed w/ all cores running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Clock speeds have meant pretty much nothing for about 5 years</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; IPC has been the focus as of late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; In fact, AMD used to whip on Intel because their IPC was higher at similar clock speeds</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gehzumteufel: not strictly true, they have meaning in terms of the computational speed when comparing CPUs w/ the same design, or say, the same CPU when it varies clock.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but yeah, i had AMD back then, when they were murdering intel. things have changed. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Well I didn't mean have entirely no use, but meant that they have no real bearing when comparing tit for tat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; They are good for determining pricing structure. That's about it. lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; they matter in scaling, too... on i3/i5 and the previous-gen iX CPUs w/ much lower TB limits w/ all cores active, you could finish some jobs faster if you kept them on fewer cores. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: what is lvm?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and what was it that you were trying to do to use multiple devices in a single volume?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or whatever that was</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; discontinuous areas into a single volume</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; TB is almost like hyperthreading though, no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; they;re talking about something like that I think on #teamdouche</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you should be on there too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gehzumteufel: um, no, it is not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel prepares to get schooled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; now and then they actually say things that are about coding :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; HT = providing two logical cores per physical core - there are 2x as many sets of dispatch hardware as execution hardware, basically.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; TB = stepping clock above stated maximum.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Right I get that aspect, but it doesn't hurt performance like HT does?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; At load that is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Or is TB pretty much equal to factory OC?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; TB = manufacturer approved OC?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it's not like OS-managed CPU clock changes, it happens automatically whenever the "regular" top clock is set, and is subject to thermal and number-of-cores-in-use limits.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; basically manufacturer-limited OC, yeah. it throttles back if it gets too hot, and the maximum allowed clock is also based on the number of cores that are not in sleep state.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Ah in that case then, TB is awesome.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it is, but i3/i5, and afaict nearly everything in the prior generation, needed you to sleep have the cores to get much of anything out of TB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; I'd never buy an i3 in the first place, so no worries on that end of the spectrum</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; timeout!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel stops</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful - lvm and what was it that you were trying that would take discontiguous areas and map to a single device/volume?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if I understand right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: LVM is about treating raw disk devices as collections of logical blocks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, they're talking about it on #teamdouche</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; UBI can't actually concatenate devices like LVM can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I want you there..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if we can do it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ciwrl|food: can he get an invite too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-green">* ciwrl|food is now known as ciwrl</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ciwrl&gt; who?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; UBI requires that we actually have one partition for all of the storage, but it can then slice that partition up into filesystems as we wish.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ubi = the regular volume manager that linux uses, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; that would be LVM. UBI is a system that does *some* of the same things, and also bad block management, for flash devices.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; hmm, not sure *what* they're talking about anymore.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it is filesystem related, started as LVM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; UBI has a baaaaaad in-kernel bug that needs to be fixed before we could actually use it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it falls over under memory pressure, and suddenly all filesystems are read-only and also corrupted. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ouch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; But, fuck I have this problem on Ubuntu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; minus the all filesystems getting corrupted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; HyperFS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; then i found out they've known about this since... 2k8 iirc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; ubifs doesn't have an fsck utility yet, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so, what *are* we working on now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful is working on codecs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; GPS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel is kidding</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; coolya on RIL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; which might fix GPS.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; gps is tied to the RIL?!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho I'm not really sure about that . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; wtf kind of shit is that?!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it started working once I thought</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lulz this is Samsung though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when we used samsung ril somehow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I am not 100% about that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; was just surprised when I heard about it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel hopes it's not actually tied to the RIL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and thought screw it - its samsung, who am I to judge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I thought it might have something to do with initialization going on somewhere</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; maybe it is just AGPS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gehzumteufel: apparently on vibrant and the cdma devices you ask the radio for the gps data... or it's involved in init, or something.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; wtf</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel finds that to be retarded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, that's what I thought.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; But this is Samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it *is* samsung. please.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I mean, they might be our manufacturer of last resort soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but still.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: i'm going to take a look at them, at least - most of them, at least superficially, appear to be omx now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; everyone else is going to locked bootloaders</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, maybe if i drop them in my /system/lib and muck about w/ that omx registry file...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful that would be very very cool if it works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or you get it working.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so you on codecs, coolya on RIL+GPS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; guess I should look at headsets</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; bad news: the two files that appear to be about mkv support reference the opencore libs :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and sound</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Is opencore, contrary to its name, not open?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; opencore is the older interface.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; they changed to what is it..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; shit, I was reading it earlier.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; now my medication is kicking in and starting to get headache</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; google it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or unhelpful or Kaik541 wil tell us in a minute</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; haha yeah. Trying to google now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's LGPL is all I know about opencore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but, right now, importing the dock audio stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; StageFright</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right, stagefright is what they went to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so using opencore is lose.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's why samsung would.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; bastids.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; how is it that there is no open source stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can linux not run this stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I don't do much video, so have never thought baout it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; For the video, the DRM that they use (for instance on the Vibrant with Avatar), there doesn't seem to be a non-mobile implementation. At least I couldn't find one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also because they already had codecs for opencore that interface w/ their hardware. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; atinm, you might want to tell people in the OP's of your threads you can only get CM nightlies if you have ROM manager premium license</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; since people arel ike "why don't I see them? blah blah blah"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah. ok</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think it was the first android app I bought</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; almost CM for your birthday wwyvern, it's getting there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; put it in the FAQs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; [B]Q: Why do I not see the nightlies in ROM Manager?[/B]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; A: Nightly builds are only visible in the premium version of ROM Manager. Koush, the developer of ROM Manager is a key reason behind Galaxy S phones having CM7. You can buy it to show your support.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Like it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ciwrl&gt; im assuming you say that the webpage for downloads has nightlies for free too right?</span><br />
