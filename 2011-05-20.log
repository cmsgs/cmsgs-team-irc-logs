<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so what are ppl talking about with "ghosting"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; it really depends: if they're somewhat experienced - they'll now that things are going on in the background</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since the new color temp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; but when they're younger - they'll probably pull the battery out or press the power button for a long time :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; just write in the howto - that it takes some time - no one's gonna read it anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; but if all else fails -&gt; it's in the howto ^^</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's funny seeing all these people complaining about not seeing CM on ROM manager... they don't have premium versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; *sigh*</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; like awesome</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no more writing changelogs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I am so happy!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; so just out of curiosity, the number (like 6, 9, etc) is just a numbering scheme that always increases?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; FOREVA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; No audience for you :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so nice to build on a real system again :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; As opposed to a fake system?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; as opposed to a pitiful one!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; got my sandy bridge back :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Oh nice.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; from core duo 2.16GHz -&gt; SB i7-2720QM 2.2GHz :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; I want to build a new machine. Get a i7 2600 and like 12gb of ram</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; although, since the iX models and turboboost, clock speeds mean pretty much nothing at all since various places will report max TB speed, max non-TB speed, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i appear to be doing about 2.7GHz @ present, i believe that's the max TB speed w/ all cores running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Clock speeds have meant pretty much nothing for about 5 years</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; IPC has been the focus as of late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; In fact, AMD used to whip on Intel because their IPC was higher at similar clock speeds</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gehzumteufel: not strictly true, they have meaning in terms of the computational speed when comparing CPUs w/ the same design, or say, the same CPU when it varies clock.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but yeah, i had AMD back then, when they were murdering intel. things have changed. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Well I didn't mean have entirely no use, but meant that they have no real bearing when comparing tit for tat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; They are good for determining pricing structure. That's about it. lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; they matter in scaling, too... on i3/i5 and the previous-gen iX CPUs w/ much lower TB limits w/ all cores active, you could finish some jobs faster if you kept them on fewer cores. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: what is lvm?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and what was it that you were trying to do to use multiple devices in a single volume?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or whatever that was</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; discontinuous areas into a single volume</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; TB is almost like hyperthreading though, no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; they;re talking about something like that I think on #teamdouche</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you should be on there too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gehzumteufel: um, no, it is not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel prepares to get schooled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; now and then they actually say things that are about coding :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; HT = providing two logical cores per physical core - there are 2x as many sets of dispatch hardware as execution hardware, basically.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; TB = stepping clock above stated maximum.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Right I get that aspect, but it doesn't hurt performance like HT does?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; At load that is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Or is TB pretty much equal to factory OC?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; TB = manufacturer approved OC?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it's not like OS-managed CPU clock changes, it happens automatically whenever the "regular" top clock is set, and is subject to thermal and number-of-cores-in-use limits.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; basically manufacturer-limited OC, yeah. it throttles back if it gets too hot, and the maximum allowed clock is also based on the number of cores that are not in sleep state.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Ah in that case then, TB is awesome.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it is, but i3/i5, and afaict nearly everything in the prior generation, needed you to sleep have the cores to get much of anything out of TB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; I'd never buy an i3 in the first place, so no worries on that end of the spectrum</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; timeout!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel stops</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful - lvm and what was it that you were trying that would take discontiguous areas and map to a single device/volume?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if I understand right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: LVM is about treating raw disk devices as collections of logical blocks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, they're talking about it on #teamdouche</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; UBI can't actually concatenate devices like LVM can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I want you there..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if we can do it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ciwrl|food: can he get an invite too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-green">* ciwrl|food is now known as ciwrl</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ciwrl&gt; who?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; UBI requires that we actually have one partition for all of the storage, but it can then slice that partition up into filesystems as we wish.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ubi = the regular volume manager that linux uses, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; that would be LVM. UBI is a system that does *some* of the same things, and also bad block management, for flash devices.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; hmm, not sure *what* they're talking about anymore.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it is filesystem related, started as LVM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; UBI has a baaaaaad in-kernel bug that needs to be fixed before we could actually use it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it falls over under memory pressure, and suddenly all filesystems are read-only and also corrupted. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ouch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; But, fuck I have this problem on Ubuntu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; minus the all filesystems getting corrupted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; HyperFS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; then i found out they've known about this since... 2k8 iirc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; ubifs doesn't have an fsck utility yet, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so, what *are* we working on now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful is working on codecs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; GPS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel is kidding</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; coolya on RIL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; which might fix GPS.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; gps is tied to the RIL?!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho I'm not really sure about that . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; wtf kind of shit is that?!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it started working once I thought</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lulz this is Samsung though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when we used samsung ril somehow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I am not 100% about that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; was just surprised when I heard about it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel hopes it's not actually tied to the RIL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and thought screw it - its samsung, who am I to judge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I thought it might have something to do with initialization going on somewhere</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; maybe it is just AGPS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gehzumteufel: apparently on vibrant and the cdma devices you ask the radio for the gps data... or it's involved in init, or something.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; wtf</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel finds that to be retarded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, that's what I thought.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; But this is Samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it *is* samsung. please.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I mean, they might be our manufacturer of last resort soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but still.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: i'm going to take a look at them, at least - most of them, at least superficially, appear to be omx now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; everyone else is going to locked bootloaders</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, maybe if i drop them in my /system/lib and muck about w/ that omx registry file...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful that would be very very cool if it works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or you get it working.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so you on codecs, coolya on RIL+GPS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; guess I should look at headsets</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; bad news: the two files that appear to be about mkv support reference the opencore libs :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and sound</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Is opencore, contrary to its name, not open?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; opencore is the older interface.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; they changed to what is it..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; shit, I was reading it earlier.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; now my medication is kicking in and starting to get headache</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; google it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or unhelpful or Kaik541 wil tell us in a minute</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; haha yeah. Trying to google now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's LGPL is all I know about opencore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but, right now, importing the dock audio stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; StageFright</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right, stagefright is what they went to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so using opencore is lose.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's why samsung would.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; bastids.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; how is it that there is no open source stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can linux not run this stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I don't do much video, so have never thought baout it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; For the video, the DRM that they use (for instance on the Vibrant with Avatar), there doesn't seem to be a non-mobile implementation. At least I couldn't find one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also because they already had codecs for opencore that interface w/ their hardware. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; atinm, you might want to tell people in the OP's of your threads you can only get CM nightlies if you have ROM manager premium license</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; since people arel ike "why don't I see them? blah blah blah"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah. ok</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think it was the first android app I bought</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; almost CM for your birthday wwyvern, it's getting there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; put it in the FAQs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; [B]Q: Why do I not see the nightlies in ROM Manager?[/B]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; A: Nightly builds are only visible in the premium version of ROM Manager. Koush, the developer of ROM Manager is a key reason behind Galaxy S phones having CM7. You can buy it to show your support.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Like it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ciwrl&gt; im assuming you say that the webpage for downloads has nightlies for free too right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;wwyvern&gt; I see that..it's a wonderful "almost a gift" :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ciwrl&gt; kk, just making sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; well, we tried..and by we I mean people smarter than me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;wwyvern&gt; Y'all are all smarter than me...(or at least have studied a lot more)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the rommanager bit is for the people asking why they don't see nightlies in RM.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; remember, these ppl are new :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; they don't know CM7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;wwyvern&gt; I'm just enjoying being able to watch the fireworks and bugtest occasionally</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we have to ween them off.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;wwyvern&gt; back in a bit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; is the *dock* only for captivate?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; because a lot of its code is #ifdef BLUH_CAPTIVATE</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; There is a dock for the vibrant too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Pretty sure the whole Galaxy S line has a dock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; i can get you guys free copies btw</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; of rm prem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; heh too late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; And I'm glad to support your work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; bastard, i already paid ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; me too! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Can't pirate everything in life</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; he prolly checked fist :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so i should probably remove any of those?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; do any of us besides me actually own one?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol no</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; oh and coolya</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he said he would test also</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think the code is #ifdef captivate because xcaliburinhand only has a captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but TMC_Sherpa can figure it out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when he sees the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; dono if its the same across devices...history says no</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; whether it would work on galaxys and vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or what gpios are different.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; maybe?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; because i'm @ work &amp; 1) i don't want to flash a kernel that might be trash 2) my dock is not here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; oh god damn it I can't get sound tested :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; TMC_Sherpa_: we need to work on sound</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you and I.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; koush: Not sure why, but RM says there are two files downloading. Is this typical for those of us already on CM?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's now my top priority.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so what needs to be tested?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; AUDIENCE? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lmao</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; yes 2 files</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; 1 is cm 1 is gapps</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Oh yes forgot I checked that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; the jvb source is much closer to froyo than the nexus stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; damn.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; it looks like it shouldn't be a (huge) problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I thought they were going towards nexus stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I just want it to work :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; first the headsets</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, if i tell rommanager to get me CM after telling it i'm captivatemtd, 1) i'll get a nightly 2) it won't be broken? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I just did.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; I'm doing it now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hot :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; captivatemtd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; does the xxxxxbml one only show if you select cwm 2.x?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; right now the sound branch is pretty contained, wwyvern says it works fine other than headphone (samsung 4 pole is fine) but gehzumteufel said voice was crap so... I'm not sure where we're at</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I can't test voice on vibrant.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I guess I could if I move my sim</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; from captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; chaembain keeps threatening to check it out but his power keeps cutting out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; You'll get 3g too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; chaembian is in india.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I know but he has vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's ok - I have one too now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can test some things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so sound branch?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; atinm:  you get notifications now right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; ask tech atinm tmc2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush_: hmm - no</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I was already on latest</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I don't know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, if this build works, it'd be best to leave those #ifdefs in for now, untill somebody can fix up dock audio for the other devices?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; I clicked on "check for updates" and it didn't seem to notify. Although maybe I didn't wait long enough</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; owait! they're actually matched to an #else...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; atinm: Is the screen on that vibrant actually broken like you were told?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; slight crack</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; heh so pretty much usable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in bottom left corner and a hairline crack across face</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; totally usable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; in fact it appears both branches are the same. :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: you need a vibrant dock now ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; LOL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, but no one gets those replaced by insurance :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; w00t RM rocks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; 'k, so, somebody else want to try <a href="https://github.com/teamhacksung/android_kernel_samsung_aries/tree/dock_audio">https://github.com/teamhacksung/android_kernel_samsung_aries/tree/dock_audio</a> ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; the, um jvb sound has the dock stuff in it already :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; where do I set it to notify me about updates?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; settings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; update notifications is checked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I guess we'll find out tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when we have another nightly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful does being in two channels hurt the ADHD?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; TMC_Sherpa_: ...so, wait, our current branch already has it? or not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I sort of want you there in #teamdouche so you can see if anything applicable to us is done on another phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; no our sound is based off of nexus</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I'm trying to get jvb audio instead 'cus it will be way easier to port the HAC tty and audience stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; TMC_Sherpa_: I would prefer it that way too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; i</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it looks much cleaner</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wait</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wut?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; jvb is worse than nexus but closer to froyo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I thought nexus was cleaner</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; for audience we would want to be closer to jvb.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; crap</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; didn</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; didn't I see audience code in JVB that was in its own driver?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: ...two? bahahahahahahah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (my interferon side-effects are starting . . . so I'm going to be weird now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, then you're fine :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; audience is part of 2.3 or something, its part of the kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; the audio routing to use it is very different tho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; vs vib or gal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wonder if we should split it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; using a config</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wm8994.c for galaxys and vibrant and another for captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I'm pretty sure renaming a few functions in wm8994_kepler will get it working, adding the ifdef to wm8994_samsung is pretty easy (for jvb)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; screw it, lets get it to work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but not mess with vibrant and galaxys.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we'll use Makefile and CONFIG_ to split it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; vibrant also uses wm8994_aries... it's kind of a pig in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; couldn't you just name it wm8994a.c for the audience based ones?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel is captain obvious</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's what I'm suggesting :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: yes, one more is not a big deal, i keep tabs on #btrfs, #eigen, #quassel, and #pypy already, and am sometimes involved in #rockbox too...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* gehzumteufel loves rockbox</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I  need more people to test the sound, if jvb is crap on everyone then it may be easier to 'fix' herring</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok - thencool.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, herring is good for everyone but captivate, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well not quite - vibrant has an issue, correct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; voice in a well or something?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and some power on/off</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; dono it seems like every vibrant user I talk to has a different audio problem :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; mute/unmute</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; the mute/unmute issue is there regardless of what sound stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, are we talking about importing the entire jvb audio driver?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; but they say it works on jvb builds so I figured change to that and then work from there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; or is that not really going to happen?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: its an idea.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; its like 80ish files</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; its almo\st contained</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; 80?!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I thought it was like 2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; just a few files outside /sound</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wm8994.c and sec_jack.c</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I moved the whole thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; it uses stuff in  s3c24xx</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; originally that is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I turned 40 in the hospital</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; my original plan was to die by 40.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; lol</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Well glad it didn't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but was too afraid of my wife :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I hadn't said bye to her</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; she was in denmark when I collapsed and was in the ICU</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; ack</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unconscious - she had to fly back not knowing if I was going to be alive when she landed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I was just too scared to die :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and now you have a wife and kid to take care of, so you're not allowed to leave :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; Exactly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I actually distinctly remember 3 times when I faced darkness.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it was just a step away.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gehzumteufel&gt; wow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I just had to step into it and there would be no pain. just silence.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's what the afterlife is for me it seems</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I stepped back</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; TMC_Sherpa_, well I'm young enough to be his kid... but I don't think that helps prove my point</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; they told me later that there were 3 times they thought I was gone</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I just thought the OEM car dock never came to light</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and it *sorta* looks like a captivate faceplate photoshopped onto a vibrant/i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; dono, I figured they might release something like that *after* they got gps working :P</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; UberPinguin, well they're here now, though apparently they (as well as fascinate) already have a booting 2.6.35</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; that's the same seller who provided my media/desktop dock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; UberPinguin, but they don't have modem working yet, so you should be able to work together on that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Kaik541: OK. We're finding a _lot_ of differences between our phones and all of the other variants :/</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it makes a nice desk clock in it, and probably nice for movies too if i add some speakers...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; thats waht you get for having a slider</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; TMC_Sherpa_: I think the slider part has relatively little to do with it ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I've already learned having netflix on my phone is a bad idea</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; it gave them an excuse to rebuilt it, make it better, faster, stronger</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it looks to me as though we are going to need two different kernels for the recovery-partition devices</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; (because the script will need to read the attached ramdisk from a different device)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; The GPIO an regulator differences alone are enough to strongly suggest a split kernel, or at least split .h and .c files with additional menuconfig entries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; no, i mean you will need a boot kernel, and a recovery kernel, with different stage1 initramfs contents</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; nullghost, Decad3nce ^</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; the thing about devices with a recovery partition is, it only uses the recovery partition if you do the three-finger boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; reboot recovery still uses the bml7 kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nullghost: oh ffs. :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; so I don't *think* it'll need a special bml8 kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ok... um, if you do the three-finger, does it change the kernel command line, like it does for us?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; It makes SBL boot a different partition afaik</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; nullghost will be able to grab a log of it tomorrow ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yes, but does it do anything *else*? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; if memory serves, regular boot = bml7, `reboot recovery` = bml7 + changed cmdline, and three-finger boot = bml8 + changed cmdline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nullghost: that's great, actually... we can use exactly the same script, and attach the boot and recovery initramfs in bml7, and flash the plain prebuilt kernel, w/o any attached stuff, to bml8.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it would still read bml7, and get the recovery initramfs from there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; Unhelpful: that's actually (minus the part about extracting the initramfs from bml7) what we do anyway.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; we can flash the exact same kernel to bml7 and bml8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; as long as both kernels contain a proper recovery binary and fota.rc / recovery.rc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nullghost: yessss, but instead of doing that, and writing a much larger kernel to bml8 w/ an initramfs attached that you'll never use, you would just flash the prebuilt kernel from the device tree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the initramfs built into the kernel doesn't have a recovery binary, or any .rc files, or init. just a script that decides if the phone is doing a normal boot or recovery, and unpacks an attached initramfs from after the kernel on bml7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it's done this way so we can build the kernel and the initramfs independently - you run a new CM build, you get a new initramfs, using whatever prebuilt kernel was committed last.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; interesting, I was wondering how the stage2 initramfs was build (we haven't gotten that far)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; built*. I really want to squash this power regulator problem =\</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; our "boot image" format is really, really awful. i designed it to be unpackable by a shell script. ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; think we broke light sensor somehow</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; Unhelpful: where is the boot image actually contained?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; we haven't even looked into building it yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nullghost: the boot image is what's we flash onto bml7 - it's a kernel w/ stage1 initramfs, then a header giving the offset and length of the boot and recovery data, and then the boot and recovery data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nullghost&gt; oh, sorry. what I meant is the initramfs. mind is fried today, I think I'm getting sick again.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; from stock eclair, i rooted, added rom manager..... grabbed build 9.......</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; techmik,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and brixed ur shit?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; instructions need to be from froyo =/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; whats the deal with RM now? is galaxyS up on it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; it rebooted 2e, i "install zip from sdcard" and went down into /sdcard/clockworkmod/...../ to the file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; installed no problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; from froyo it repeatedly booted into 3e and failed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; techmik, did you try downloading the ROM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; using adb reboot recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; to get into CWM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and just install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; you don't *have* to use ROM manager</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i tried 1 click in rom manager... download, and then it asked about wiping at backing up.... i made my choices and it said it would reboot to cwm, but it rebooted 2e</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; my piont is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; you don't have to use ROM manager</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; just put the zip on your sdcard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; so i finished manually and chose it and it went fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; from CWM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; yes, that worked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?title=Nexus_One:_Full_Update_Guide#Flashing_CyanogenMod">http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?title=Nexus_One:_Full_Update_Guide#Flashing_CyanogenMod</a> &lt;--- aka amon_ra instructions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; once they're already on CM7 that's not a problem, they don't *need* ROM manager for initial install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; RM for initial doesn't work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it does but apparently techmik can't get it to work with a froyo kernel with CWM integrated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; correct</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; when it should be identical to using the anykernel update.zip CWM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i flashed the speedmod kernel pointed to in the wiki</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hrm.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; but it still rebooted 3e, not into clockwork</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; but</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's the same one I used and I used the old initial.zip just ROM manager "install from sd card" option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; when i powered off and used 3 button</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; it did boot cwm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; techmik - you on galaxys?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; there is a speedmod for cappy?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; techmik: "just flash a stock ROM first" :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i did</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; 3e</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; techmik, when you were on KB1 with speedmod</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; what happened when you used ROM manager's "reboot to recovery"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ... i thought this happened coming from a froyo w/ speedmod?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; it would have worked with a 3e bypass kernel, cause it tried to auto flash</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i got the old failed to verify signature error</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; not install from sd card</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; just the "reboot to recovery" option at the very top</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i had 2 attempts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; 1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; from froyo, kb1, stock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; any bad flash blocks, yet? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; flashed speedmod, rooted, installed rom manager, told it to flash nightly.... it rebooted to the 3e signature error</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes, but I'm asking</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; did you ever try just clicking the "reboot to recovery" option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; no, not from froyo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think the problem is that you still had your configuration files for ROM manager on your sdcard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; for the update.zip method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so it tried to do a different method of rebooting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; after rooting with speedmod i could/should have flashed a 2e kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i bet that wwould have worked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but there's no point in adding an extra step</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I'm pretty sure it would worked if you had deleted the /sdcard/clockworkmod folder</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; i would do it now, but i *just* finished resetting everything.... i need a few before wiping again</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[8:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; we'd need to rework it to work over MTD, i imagine</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[8:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; well, this comes from an official source drop afaik</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; that doesn't mean its gpl</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; still doesn't make it GPL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; its still copyrighted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's unfortunate, but Unhelpful and aylooc|work are right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; ah, k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; htc users use leaked engineering bootloaders... would it really be so terrible to use these sources?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; are those bootloader part of CM? ....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; they have to be flashed in order for CM to install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but CM doesn't bundle them =/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; yes but it is not part of cm, just because cm depends on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yeah...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; a kernel module is way different then a bootloader</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; just using some leaked part of software, is much different then modifying leaked source, building it and bundling it with cm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; indeed... perhaps somebody could document the STL and BML algorithms so that somebody else could write a new module implementing block device drivers for them over MTD?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; fair enough, I won't try and argue that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; or we could ask our contact, since this is apparently from their source drop, to have the license fixed up, since as things are now, nobody can distribute a module built from this, including them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; yeah but i know the answer "its in code review"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; we cant use that why?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; not GPL</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; they simply don't define *any* of the same symbols as the media libraries we're using... and i'm especially concerned that none of them appear to define symbols that look obviously part of some sort of codec registration interface.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i don't think the "OMX" referenced by the codecs we use now and that referenced by these codecs is the same.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; but seeing that they're useable by other players too, they seem to be tied into the os/kernel, not just into the sammy video player</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; so they must be exposed to the other video apps in some standardized way</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; that is just the vendor behind the GPU</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; yeah, but it is almost the standard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; almost every chip seems to implement it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; they don't make gpu - they license the design</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; and the chip makers put it on their chip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; yes they are like arm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; so maybe we can use OMAP like teamdouche suggested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; we should look at least</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; we could looks at the nooks it is omap pvr</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; approved but not merged</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; it did.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; got approved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; not sure it is merged</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; but no hurry - its not a deal breaker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; can wait for nightly :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; now we have working nightlies, there is no pressure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; and I'm sick as a dog again - damn interferon side-effects</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; so won't be doing much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; coolya, how is the status of RIL/kernel for vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; that is still behind the other kernels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; they got merged: <a href="http://r.cyanogenmod.com/#change,5464">http://r.cyanogenmod.com/#change,5464</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; how do we tell approved vs merged?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; that says approved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; atinm|sick: it will do it when i am home after work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; ah</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; today: coding night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; awesome</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; coolya|away: is the ugly ril framework hack you were working on already in the repo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; what is our pvr version? 540?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; i'll look again at gpio's and on this damn headset issue</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; pwned Wout</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; we need TMC_Sherpa - he really knows the sound stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; even if things get confused from all the different versions of source</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; froyo, jvb,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; in fact, codeworkx - you should compare gpios to jvb source</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; ill try the headset for myself to be able to tell whats really not working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; rather than froyo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; atinm, did diff with jvb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; i'm just wondering what the pvr drivers should have to do with video codecs? or what is the problem with the pvr drivers we have</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; you guys on #teamdouche?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; we need open source so we can see what it is doing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; no, im at work. online with phone xD</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; because our drivers may have weird interfaces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; that we're not calling</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; from framework. I think the codecs are actually built to use the pvr</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; because codecs know about hardware</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; but may need init stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; yes but they don't use the the pvr directly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; from what I saw of the chip docs, I think they do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; or can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; its done with overlay and copying data between frambuffers by dma</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; lemme bring it up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I need to print the thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; did unhelpful try the omx registry thing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; the version we have is not searchable easily</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; codeworkx: mkv uses opencore :-P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; is what he said</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; while gingerbread is stagefright. so not sure - did you give him jvb?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; omx is openmax</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; hardware accel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; afaik video handling is done with an overlay windows, that is rendered in its own framebuffer, this buffers is copied to the main fb window using dma. the special framebuffer if fed by an dsp (mfc in our case)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; aylooc|work: ok - I was sure I saw codec stuff in the chip, but pain to search the doc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; too many pieces.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; all that is controlled by the FIMC that can setup those pathes to the different frambuffers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; the pvr is only used for 3d operation like open gl and opel els</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; omx onky supports h264 baseline profile</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; do we even have opencore on our source?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; external/opencore?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; guess not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; so how do the mkv codecs link to opencore..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; guess they don't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; and die?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; guys - what codecs are we lacking?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; mkv</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; tell him.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; its good. their software is poop</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; So conflicting :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; afternoon all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; I'm considering splitting a drivers/video/samsung/epic and arch/arm/mach-sv5pv210/epic dir, and putting our changes to gpio and regulator in there.

<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; nice nightly release for i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; UberPinguin: that's fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; ok. From a merging perspective, would "epic" or "victory" be preferable for that dir name?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Or something else?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; we use aries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; is victory similar?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; or is that somethign else</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; victory is what samsung calls Epic internally</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; but it is still aries?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I guess victory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; just to confuse ppl ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; haha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; could do aries-victory?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; that's better</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; cool.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; do you need like license and stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Yeah, I got ordained via the Internet a couple days ago</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; lol.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; lol</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; but you're not going to be here sunday..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; rapture and all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; tho maybe internet ministers will most probably stay :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; I was sorely tempted to go with the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, but I don't want to give the county clerk any reason to reject it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; lol rapture</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; I wonder what the "basis" for it being on the 21st is, anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; aylooc|work: do you know what rapture is or is that just an american thing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; i have no clue what that is</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; oh - rapture: "when the righteous will go to heaven, while the rest of us stay on earth"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; And get all t heir stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; or tonight</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; And wives/gfs/etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I think they go on a spaceship</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; tho I'm unclear on that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Nah, the Heaven's Gate folks caught their comet years ago</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; basically the crazies think they're going to heaven tomorrow</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; I remember the 1st time I got that on a CM gerrit patch. I didn't realize it was a default value, thought it was the guy getting personal.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Isn't cognition discontinued? Or maybe that was perception</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; have we got any user reports about the missing hw playback ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes - mkv files just showing black</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; because i can play H264 in 1280 x 544 fine</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; that will fail anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; works fine on sammy rom :) so the files are good for testing hw codecs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; we don't have enough ram for the fimc to handle such a frame size</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; we could give them more but that will reserve ram for it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; is that our problem?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; i really don't get the point why i should play 1080p on such a small display</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; aylooc|work: Because with DLNA and HDMI, you can play it to a larger screen?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; Though I don't even know if CM works with either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; we have no hdmi output?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; its about not having to convert an existing library for your phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; we have composite</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; The hardware is *supposed* to support it afaict, aylooc|work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; I have a NAS with dozens of 1080 mkv movies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; and it's nice to stream them through dlna</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; Wout`: use subsonic :-P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I thought we could see anything mkv</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; couldnt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; coolya|away: dont think that'll run on a 1.2ghz arm nas :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; UberPinguin:  the hw *migh* support it, that hasn't been proven yet. the fsa chip is able to route the hdmi output to usb but no one know if is connected</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; diff3 output is kinda bullshit but <a href="http://pastebin.com/qg7sv0gx">http://pastebin.com/qg7sv0gx</a> are the gpio diffs from settings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;UberPinguin&gt; aylooc|work: I remember reading that it's supposed to be able to use the 3.5mm as a vout, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; Wout`: i'm running it on a atom 1.6Ghz nas :-P</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; i always get ~50% cpu no madder what res the video is, so i think we are actually using hw decoding for h264</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; atinm: actually we can only play h264 baseline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right, I thought that was what we're trying to solve - need the codecs for the others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; then this is _NOT_ sgs specific this is AOSP missing a decoder for it</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so wondering if we can kang them somehow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ylooca|work&gt; do they ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes - that was my understanding</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but someone else has to confirm - remember, this is all new to me - I just know video as one of the things that make CM7 on SGS "not as good as stock"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; on jvb there are files like libs264eomxoc.so</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we care why?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I am trying to get rid of samsung source.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; not add crap</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; ^^</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; atinm, Unhelpful and coolya had some ideas with it (for param stuff and bml, but it went over my head)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; thought that *could* help with JVB source - since samsung uses itself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; in case mtd would cause trouble</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; but it seems to work fine so far</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, params is the only thing I can think of as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; mtd is working fine for 6 month on my phone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; atinm: did you see my zip`?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; there is no reason to move to their crap.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no - what zip?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; secril had rfs calls in it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; coolya, yeah, no issues so far - since I migrated to CM7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md&gt; that's been mid / beginning of March</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; TMC_Sherpa_: no its not the file system, its just the name of the export</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; it is missleading</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik_laptop&gt; why does it only build if i manually copy libcamera.so?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; atinm: all samsung closed source modules, like param.blk driver</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; cool, so we could use params?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; i think we can make it work, i have some idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; like using our bml over mtd to dump the partition, then use j4fs source to mount that image as loop and use the samsung kernel module to read/write to it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; dunno if that would be working but that way we could avoud using fsr stuff from samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; maybe hacky but might work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; hmm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; :-P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok - no mic.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; with the samsung 4 pole or just headphones?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; interesting wwyvern said it was fine</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so not even detecting it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; oh, thats mach-aries then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I just pulled techmik tmc2 branch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; do I need to do somethign else?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I'm not doing anything in aries yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so how do you know it works..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; just straight headphone?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; wwyvern said it did, I don't have a vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's fine - that's why I'm here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but we're not detecting the mic yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we need the mach-aries stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; for that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; what else should I test?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; is it only voice calls? everything else should work fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; voice search.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but it doesn't matter.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it doesn't detect the headset</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; with reciever or headphones?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it is thinking it is 3 pole, because it is reading the adc=0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so defaults to 3 pole</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we are not reading the adc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; the adc values in aries are high</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; er than jvb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it isn't reading anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; but if anyone was going to get screwed by that it should be captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; its just not being enabled.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; vibrant is different about micbias</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; yeah I know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I did a test, if you set _EN to the EN2 value and remove the ifdef vibrant shit in aries it does work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; all the vibrants I've seen are ref f so don't use _EN for anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I see both getting set.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; in test zero when it touched _en on the vibrant it would reboot...which I think is handy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; dono, there is some logic around _EN n the vibrant to see if it should twiddle it or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; there is stuff in the code talking about red B and rev D wm8994 chips, dono if that applies to us or if its for dev/future phones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; evening all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; but it seems like vibrant people all have different sound issues, or at least a different issue they want fixed first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; one thing at a time - lets just detect the damn thing first.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; where is the adc table?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; mach-aries somewhere, don't have it up right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; just look for _EN</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wow, this table looks wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; actually....no. well, maybe. it would need to be merged</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; everything on the nexus is backwards</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; adc_max should be 3400 for vibrant and galaxy but only like 2500 on captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; so if it was screwing anyone it should be us</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; hangon, lemme get this stupid displaycase shipped</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; rather than most of what we hacked in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; and some of that got hacked in for nexus</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik&gt; and now its building</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; MICBIAS_EN2=1 and read adc for vibrant according to froyo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I know it reads it at a different time than the other phones, but I thought that was already hacked in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we do EARPATH_SEL=1,EN2=1,EN=1 and then read</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; which is wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; EARPATH_SEL=1 is done later for vibrant in froyo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and EN=1 is not done if we're F</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; correct</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so just a bug we have</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; try the mach-aries I linked, it will need to get merged 'cus of all the other tchanges to it that happened since 0511</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; but it uses a built in function that we commented out or something, I don't remember, but the funtion call can get moved for vibrant if we need to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; I will be honest, 0511 was a long time ago(?!) and I don't remember everything I did in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; but it should only be audio related</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-green">* Kaik541 (~IWasNever@cpe-70-112-175-254.austin.res.rr.com) has joined this channel.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; let me look at it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; after test1 (which used s5p-rp...which had fingers everywhere) I wanted to just get it down to the minimum number of files to play with, if it made noise on all the phones then I was going to work on step 2 and make sure the audio paths were correct for everone and that the headphone shit worked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa_&gt; vibrant has some deal called HAC which doesn't look like it does anything (like tty on captivate) so there are changes in wm8994_samsung for each phone.  vibrant also has extra voice paths (like captivate) in wm8994_aries (or kepler)</span><br />
