<span class="irc-date">[5:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i need to figure out how it sets up iptables for tether, it's setting up rules w/ eth0 as the WAN interface, which is wrong and doesn't work.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the problem is that it's trying to route packets from my computer *to the internet* via eth0.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; where are the routres defined?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; where does it decide what's the WAN interface when setting up forwarding? i don't know.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; the route config would determine that i would imagine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; one sec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; *what* route config?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the *regular linux* routing table has pdp0 as the default route</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but the iptables packet forwarding is trying to set up w/ eth0 as the default route, and that won't work at all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; i'd imagine android linux would use ppp0 unless eth0 is active</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, it might if i were trying to share the wifi via tether?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, the question is what sets up iptables for forwarding, and where/how does it make its decisions?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko&gt; normal iptables or samsung iptables?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; either of those is just a utility that does what you tell it to do. who decides what to tell it? :P</span><br />
