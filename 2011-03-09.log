<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tonight is going to be no testing for me - I'm burnt out. Kaik541, request for you though. Can you check CM threads to see if mic button works in CM7 on other phones? Mine is acting weird but it isn't the kernel misbehaving and it looks more like a bug up above.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I can try, sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Mine basically goes into a play/pause infinite loop when I press the mic button. It starts the music player, starts playing a song and then that song just goes into play/pause loop in a .5 second cycle.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; as if you kept hitting the button over and over?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but kernel is not sending any more events up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so you want me to find out if our controls work on say the vibrant or i9000?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it just sends the one. it is as if apps are not agreeing on who has AudioFocus</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; more like just search first - don't ask and look silly ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh of course, but I think the i9000 doesn't ship with similar headphones, not sure about the vibrant though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and yes, see if the mic  button works on other SGS phones - I didn't think it did</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; Kaik541: what headset is shipped with captivate ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; I9000 ships with one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and my logcat just seems to go between phone apk, sms apk, music apk in a loop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; in ear headphones with built in music controls and microphone I believe (I never used mine)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; one button ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes, mic has a button. single press starts/pause</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; if yes, its the smae</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; double press forward, triple back.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (on samsung music player)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; not sure about gingerbread. it should at least play/pause</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and mine does - only in a half second cycle :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I haven't slept in a few nights, so burnt.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I committed my partial fix to atinm/android_kernel_samsung so I don't lose it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but didn't want to put it on teamhacksung yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since it isn't actually fixed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so wait, we have someone in here with an i9000 (coolya) and when dasun pops back in he has a vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; hell,coolya has a vibrant too... what exactly am I supposed to be on the lookout for?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zerojay&gt; I just built and can test if needed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think dasun already said that mic doens't work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he was the one who said the two click to forward, three to go back</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I didn't konw mic button could do that :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I think that might be a samsung music app thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because we actually have 3 separate events in the kernel driver for play/pause, next song, previous song</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but our mic only sends up on because it only has the one adc value</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but if we all have the same headphones and they work the same... (that is none of them work yet)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but play/pause should work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I don't think it will</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; at least on sgs phones - our drivers haven't been fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I was curious about other brands</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; OH</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; you want me to see if DIFFERENT headphones work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; about whether it is a gingerbread bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; non-stock with inline controls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I read somewhere that it might be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but lost the link</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; other phone brands</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since gingerbread is the same</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I think I'm doing the correct thing in the kernel now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; may blackberry 3 button headset is in my car i can fetch them tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; oh, while you're at it - find out if Nexus S has a three button headset :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because the code looks like it might.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; but i'm really tired</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; hmm, I have my blackberry phones somewhere</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, once i hit the home key to get out of the music player screen it becomes fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but it looks like a 4 pole one, can't really tell =/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so it really looks like a gingerbread/music app bug.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I see three lines on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it should be 4 pole</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since it has to have a mic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the question is whether the mic button has three buttons</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as opposed to our one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh I know, I'll just ask curio</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; still, right now it is looking like a gingerbread bug to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he has an i9000 and nexus s</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so he would know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I would be surprised if he hasn't already fixed the bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since he is working in sound so much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; worth asking</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I asked, but he ignored me like we've been ignoring his voodoo stuff ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; should i be an asshole on the issue tracker or not ?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; which one?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I was already an ass to that person who complained about no market apps</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; no market app*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; curio says he *thinks* they're the same, but he can't tell as he enver used them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so I'm asking if he has any headphones with inline controls that work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; and my sd is corrupt, with no logs no info about file system on the external sd and running some custom kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I also got a private message and a twitter msg about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; apparently an iphone's headphones with inline controls should work (it worked on the nexus s)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I ignored them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so if anyone has an iphone's old headphones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nexus one*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; like when did I say that I was going to start providing user support in private messages.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; at least post publicly so you can look like an idiot.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; because there is a very, very big difference between stashing a value in a signed vs unsigned temporary before you *subtract an offset* from it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and if the eventual destination of the value is signed, i'm thinking that doing the subtraction as unsigned is a huge mistake</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; not enough to help at the moment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Well, it seems he fixed the download mode problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; he has a JV1 bootloader though?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; that could be an issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; No, he had installed another bootloader and couldn't get into download mode anymore, but he didn't know about the 3-button-combo</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I wonder though, what keyboards do they use? lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:38]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful knows none but is vaguely familiar w/ th stolen japanese versions. only a little, really only properly learned kana before quitting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; they use pinyin input methods</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:38]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* evaluate googles pinyin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; The number of Chinese characters contained in the Kangxi dictionary is approximately 47,035, although a large number of these are rarely used variants accumulated throughout history.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's kindal ike writing the sounds out in romance text</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; pinyin is basically Roman wording with accent marks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; roman*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; uhum</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; erm, characters</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: i believe there are CJK keyboards that let you compose characters from radicals... also you can use regular keyboards w/ an IME that translates from a romanized format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; japanese has a similar system called "romanji"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; gah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; install google pinyin if you want to play around with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; which is why you can write "konnichiwa"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; uberushaximus: i assume pinyin is strictly standardized if you're supposed to be able to enter in it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; I have pinyin on my linux box</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Someone really has to introduce a universal language.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Yangtse&gt; I did not solve that problem. I had the question is: I do not know how to enter the download mode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; and yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I just like Japan's style of language, steal everyone else's language</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; romanji/romaji is, erm... i think there's *supposed* to be a standard but it's not really very strictly adhered to?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; make trips over to China as a war, and come back with a few kanji every time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Yangtse&gt; yes aptitude install ibus-pinyin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; 我喜还中文</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and then whenever you hear a word from another language, import it as katakana</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and romanji is very strict (if you're taught properly)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Yangtse, hmm. To enter download mode you have to use the 3-button-combo. Press the Volume UP + Home + Power buttons all at the same time and wait a couple of seconds. When the download icon appears release the buttons.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; especially the long "o" sounds</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Wikipedia has a good summary of the basic pinyin rules</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; I should just take up japanese since I know a lot more of it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; because most romanji has to be brought over to their japanese counterparts, so there are certain letters you can never use</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Seriously, there has to be a universal language. I've even seen an interesting one that might fit, since it's based on logics.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Can't remember it's name though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; English is becoming a language family, which is kinda neat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; English sucks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's ingrained itself in so many cultures that they're all absorbing and adapting it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; the only other competing language on the scale of english is mandarin chinese based on population</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; in 100 years, they say it'll be so widespread and changed, that someone speaking "Australian English" and someone speaking "British English" will be incapable of understanding each other</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; beyond basic communication</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Yangtse&gt; I opened the odin, and then plug in the phone, press and hold the three keys to enter download mode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; "English" will be the new latin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Okay Yangtse then what?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dudyk&gt; I heard that in India, people speak English when talking to people in different villages since there are too many dialects...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Yangtse, you have to enter download mode BEFORE you plug the phone into the computer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yep, which is why English is permeating literally everywhere</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Seriously though, I don't think English would fit as an universal language.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but it will</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Kaik541: and musical instruments, legends, myths, other cultural things... :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; english has too many retarded rules</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it has all the necessary components</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dudyk&gt; Esperanto rocks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; uberushaximus, yup.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; chinese actually makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's adaptable, it's easy to understand gramatically (but not colloquially)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Kaik541, like?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: not strictly true! on at least captivate volup+voldn+usbplug is a way to enter download...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; you can literally make up English words on the spot with it's rules about compound-wordage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; not every langauge is that adaptable (Chinese is one of them)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Kaik541: we have the *least* sane loan-word "system", though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh I know, we just garble other languages into ours</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-green">* coolya|away is now known as coolya</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; japan's loan word system is fun</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, yeah, but I find this the easiest method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but most languages are pretty rigid about what makes it in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, and I guess it also works on all devices</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; japanese does a decent job too though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; garble nothing, we borrow th words as-is and as a result there is no way to know how to spell a word you hear, or how to pronounce a word you see.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I meant garble as in we pull them in until the point where there are no set rules in language</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Hey coolya, it's languistics hour</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the japanese way makes more sense, fit the pronunciation to the syllabary before adopting the word.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; English is just that special cousin that dabbled in too many drugs</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; What I dislike most about the English language is that you can have words that are written the same, but mean different things (did you read the book? Yes, I read it) and are also pronounced different. That makes no fucking sense.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I don't know if you go that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; yeah, I saw that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yeah, homonyms and homophones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; dudyk, well, it's supposed to make sense when you read it too...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think that also kind of shows the adaptability of the language in a sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Pinyin is like that too evaluate :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but I'll be the first to admit that English is kind of a clusterfuck</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but it has a lot of common roots with almost all lang</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; languages*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Kaik541, yeah, that's true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; except asian and cyrillic ones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; germanic anglo languages*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; like the prefix "uber" has made it into common vernacular, but we apparently use it for the wrong meaning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'd really like someone to "invent" a language with very few rules, one that's easy to learn and easy to understand. Not like German where you have all those 'der', 'die', 'das'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Kaik541: yes, yes we do :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: in your example "read" and "read" aren't different words at all, just a verb that is is the same in several tenses.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; we use it to mean "super" when it should mean like, what? "top" or something?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; über in German (what the word uber is derived from) means 'on' or 'above'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; also English is actually supposed to use umlauts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; and not super or superior</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; in words with double hard vowel sounds</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; uberushaximus, not really.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; like the word "noel"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it should be no�l</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Kaik541: no, that's a trema. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, yes, I know, I just couldn't come up with a better example, there are many though...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well the umlaut is what I know it as since I was raised in Germany :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_umlaut">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_umlaut</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; also, according to wikipedia, the mark itself is called an umlaut, but the grammar term is "trema"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; ahaha "rock dots"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Kaik541: the usage to indicate a single vowel which shifts in sound is an umlaut. the trema is the one you were talking about. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trema_%28diacritic%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trema_%28diacritic%29</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yeah I'm reading the page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; The phonological phenomenon of umlaut occurred historically in English as well (man ~ men; full ~ fill; goose ~ geese) in a way cognately parallel with German, but English orthography does not write the sound shift using the umlaut diacritic. Instead, a different letter is used.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hey, did you know we don't need to swap or invert any axes in the driver?</span><br />
