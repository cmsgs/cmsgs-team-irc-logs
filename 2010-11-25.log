<span class="irc-date">[5:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's funny, I've never seen someone not care about rolling rock... they either hate it or love it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think it's just a preference... for instance, budweiser products make me feel like throwing up almost instantly</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I pretty much only drink two types of beer, and they're both pale ales</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and occasionally my friend will convince me that Foster's is fun to drink because it comes in massive cans with about twice the alcohol content of normal beer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but when I do social drinking, I'm stupid and go straight liquor usually</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I usually end up being the person who has *just* enough ability to control himself when I'm drunk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and will occasionally do stupid things like knock drinks out of people's hands and blame it on them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I haven't been drunk in probably a month and a half, before that probably about 3 months</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I'm very infrequent with my drinking</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I do horribly inappropriate things when I drink, so I tend to try not to get drunk so much anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; friend's 21st birthday party, this guy is crushing on her all night, she goes to the bathroom, I walk up and tell him she's easy and will do anything as long as he focuses enough attention on her</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and he's ALL over her for the rest of the night, and she sends him home because she doesn't do one-night stand style stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I'm just sitting there laughing my ass off because I set him up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and the next morning I kinda sat there going "I don't know much about that kid, what if he had tried to rape her? oh well"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I've learned the day after heavy drinking is a cycle of apologies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; half the time to people I don't know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; found my friend's shoes in another person's house I'd never been to before because I'd apparently gone over to that house, let myself in, and brought his shoes along</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and it wasn't like, another house where people were partying... I just walked into some house and chilled on the couch and watched TV with them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and just got up and left after I realized I didn't know anyone there or where I was</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I wish Zilch was here, he told me an amazing drinking story once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; where he lugged either a washing machine or dryer something like 2 miles in the middle of winter in Michigan or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; just so he could throw rocks at it in his friend's front yard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh I'm incredibly INCREDIBLY boring when I get high</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I talk a lot, get cotton mouth, and worry my mouth will stay that way forever and chug a gallon of water</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and then usually fall asleep</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; smoke more sativa</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; sleeep less</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so whatever they put in the bong is what i smoke</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; the only thing I'm actually thrilled about doing is acid</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; my friend was trying to convince me it's a bad idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and her logic is "it's like looking througha  kaledioscope for an hour and a half"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I'm like "uhh, that just sounds awesome"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; hour and a half?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; if it's not good acid, it's gross acid</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; the only way to know good acid isto know its source, which isn't easy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; my friend has this repetitive pattern iece of art on his wall</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and about an hour or so into it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he starts freaking out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and getting mad at the pattern</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he accused the painting of trying to eat him</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; because it was spreading across the walls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I'm like "o... k" because I'm not high at all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I've learned it's really fun for you, but terrifying for your friend to chase them around the house with the thing they're afraid of</span><br />
