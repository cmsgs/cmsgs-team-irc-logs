<span class="irc-date">[5:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I pretty much only drink two types of beer, and they're both pale ales</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and occasionally my friend will convince me that Foster's is fun to drink because it comes in massive cans with about twice the alcohol content of normal beer</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I haven't been drunk in probably a month and a half, before that probably about 3 months</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I do horribly inappropriate things when I drink, so I tend to try not to get drunk so much anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; friend's 21st birthday party, this guy is crushing on her all night, she goes to the bathroom, I walk up and tell him she's easy and will do anything as long as he focuses enough attention on her</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and he's ALL over her for the rest of the night, and she sends him home because she doesn't do one-night stand style stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I'm just sitting there laughing my ass off because I set him up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and the next morning I kinda sat there going "I don't know much about that kid, what if he had tried to rape her? oh well"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I've learned the day after heavy drinking is a cycle of apologies</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; found my friend's shoes in another person's house I'd never been to before because I'd apparently gone over to that house, let myself in, and brought his shoes along</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and it wasn't like, another house where people were partying... I just walked into some house and chilled on the couch and watched TV with them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and just got up and left after I realized I didn't know anyone there or where I was</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I wish Zilch was here, he told me an amazing drinking story once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; where he lugged either a washing machine or dryer something like 2 miles in the middle of winter in Michigan or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; just so he could throw rocks at it in his friend's front yard</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I talk a lot, get cotton mouth, and worry my mouth will stay that way forever and chug a gallon of water</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and then usually fall asleep</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; smoke more sativa</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; the only way to know good acid isto know its source, which isn't easy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; my friend has this repetitive pattern iece of art on his wall</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and about an hour or so into it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he starts freaking out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and getting mad at the pattern</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he accused the painting of trying to eat him</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; because it was spreading across the walls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I'm like "o... k" because I'm not high at all</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ideally yes - so everyone knows where we are and what to work on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right now no one is using it - except noobnl put in one issue that was fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, how about you build and try to run and just put in everything you find ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (I'm working on recovery again)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because CyanogenMod's version isn't quite what we want for Samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as in, the bmlutils isn't complete</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so just testing my changes right now and will check in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (turkey day is a no-op at my place...)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, we're not really turkey eaters per se :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and lately the significant other is on a major vegetarian thing so ..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah - luckily none of that. we got all the fixings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but no turkey (or turkey alternatives)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; stuffing without the turkey :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah - I never liked turkey before, so am quite happy without it :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; my only significant loss has to do with football since we don't have a TV either!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and patriots play today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I watch on my computer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; on fast-forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (I have a tv dongle on my computer so it catches off the air stuff)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so  my tv watching is usually relegated to 6:30am before kid waks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wakes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; while I wait for something to finish compiling . . .</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; k. just testing recovery again but need to have a turd file on there to tell me whether it really installed the new kernel :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; not quite reimplementing - just adding bmlwrite and using it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but next step would be to actually do the work in the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; rather than calling out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, the mounts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes. they're not really needed per se.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, mount  might be useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; basically redbend is copyrighted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we'd rather use our own</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; bmlwrite is the same thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, does the same thing as far as we are concerned</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the main cm repo just does a dd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; which will not work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because bml7 is readonly unless you use an ioctl to enable writes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;GuiPer_&gt; ? sorry just came now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;GuiPer_&gt; somebody else having problems with building it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;GuiPer_&gt; latest version does not boot on my phone...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; latest version of recovery?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;GuiPer_&gt; some memory leak or similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; one sec, I need to check in one more thing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in recovery?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;GuiPer_&gt; the whole cm6 for i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; oh, ok . . . umm, I haven't synced up completely yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;GuiPer_&gt; no i can get into recovery, but if i want to boot it gets kinda of stuck in the logo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; sec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm actually just trying recovery independent of cm6 right now - so I have a known good thing I am trying to boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and that seems to work fine.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so the problem might be somewhere else.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; use the froyo branch for one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; for some reason when I sync, I am not on the froyo branch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wtf . . . brb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; anonymous: why anon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we're talking "work" :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; anyway - did you figure out recovery bmlutils and what I changed?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; because logging is evil</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, yes. but useful for a development channel!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho Kaik really needs to remember this is being logged ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I had to read thru his drunken partying while reading thru last nights logs ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah - I noticed you were not stopping him :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, checked in cmsgs/android_bootable_recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; this should "just work".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; to restore kernel. the current CM version won't.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I also added Reboot Download - because just Reboot Recovery from recovery isn't as useful as being also able to get into Download mode from recovery.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; repo sync tho gets confused because we've gone from having our manifest point to our own android_bootable_recovery to pointing to CM's and back to ours</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; where ours is now a clone of CM's plus my mods.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I just rm -rf bootable/recovery and then did a repo sync.</span><br />
