<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; rhcp: just report the same thing every time for RM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; can still hac kit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: yes, we don't really have a choice about that, our bootloaders are proprietary and don't support a separate initramfs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; Unhelpful: what i was talking about in #cwr is this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; currently your packed zImage looks something like:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; header|initramfs|zimage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; what i'm proposing is this:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; header|stub-loader-initramfs|zImage|recovery|boot</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; the stub loader just looks at the end of the image for what it realy wants to load</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; loads it, then continues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; so a secondary initramfs loading process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think we've done something like that before</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; atinm, you created a multi-stage init right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wassup?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-green">* acdbx (~acdbx@cpe-66-75-28-44.san.res.rr.com) has joined this channel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in froyo days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm coming in the middle of this - what's going on?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i like that idea a lot. i assume the stub just reads from the mtd device?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm sorry - I have to go for a few minutes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: Unhelpful: why was that idea dropped?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; kid has to be put to bed ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; back in 10-15min.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; np</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the "multi-stage" init was iirc only part of the voodoo script-as-init business.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I think it was only used because it wouldn't fit by default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so he used extra space elsewhere on the device (he ended up using sdcard I think, but is there any reason we couldn't use bml8 since ours is empty?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; why would a multistage take more than a normal init?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; take more space* rather</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it was used for packaging CWM+voodoo+a few other things, I wasn't very knowledgeable (not that I really am now) back then, so I may be misremembering</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; sorry. at the time we didn't have source for the kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* neldar (~neldar@217.25.166.97) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; all we had was the kernel from samsung, so wrote a script to extract the initramfs from it, and insert it back into it. but we couldnt' have a bigger initramfs than what the kernel started with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so when we wanted more space, I ended up creating a 2 step one, the first just loaded the initramfs from the sdcard at init time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (still don't know what we're talking about - reading back the logs)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: 1) voodoo added a *lot* to the initramfs 2) we had to fit it in original initramfs space - so it loaded the "real" contents via script.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and it still doesn't solve the problem of detecting requested boot mode, we need to mess w/ the parameter filesystem for that, since it's what bootloader uses for lpm.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i guess the "pre-init" could have that code, too, so it needn't "pollute" the init source ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; dang, I need to catch up, both here and #cwr.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; why are we still talking rfs ..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or is the idea to try to keep samsung roms working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; well, my goal is to get a cwr that doesnt suck fucking dick on samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; and that means rfs support sadly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; even though i hate it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes, the one good thing about doing cm7 for samsung has been the lack of rfs in my life</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and therefore lack of every damn lagfix crap on the planet . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I see your point.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; we would really, *really* rather be able to move away from rfs as the base filesystem for cm on sgs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we basically have it. our biggest issue is the param.lfs. not rfs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; Unhelpful: i 100% agree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: elaborate?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we don't have rfs. koush_ have you actually tried CM7 on sgs? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we basically complete replaced it with mtd/yaffs2/ext4.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; param.lfs is where the boot stuff is stored. it's not rfs, it's j4fs, and as near as we can tell, essentially a fixed on-disk structure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; after you flash the first update kernel, we convert the filesystems and never have to deal with rfs again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; param.lfs is the only open issue for us - that's where the boot params to the kernel come in at</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so next thing is going to be to just read it block wise.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and get at them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; its supercurio etc who are not CM7 that are still in rfs world.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; CM7 is clean. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and horrid compass sensor crap, i'm talking with somebody in #eigen about how to finish the job there. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you should get your captivate out of the drawer and flash CM7 on it :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (you used to have a captivate if I remember right)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (which is why I'm not contributing to the discussion in #cwr - to me is it unrelated to CM7.x for SGS . . .)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lagfix discussions are so last year.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful had a good laugh the other day at a big deal being made on twitter of adding no_auto_da_alloc to ext4 mount options</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; oh god . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; btw, anyone made any more progress on the kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I had to leave for work related stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but I'm getting tired of the SGX crap - using the new libraries just kills the captivate dead black.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I am thinking of attacking it in the other direction.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we have working CM7 now. pull in pieces of the samsung GB dump for the parts we need to fix/update. leave the rest alone.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ANDROID_PMEM seems to be needed on captivate for some reason I haven't figured out yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; atinm: i didnt get black screen, i got theh multicolor screen forever</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; the*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; with the laast build attempt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; techmik67: I reverted a couple of my commits</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; haven't pushed yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; was trying a few different things. I hate just playing in the defconfig which is all we seem to be doing right now. I am back to the state I was in last night where kernel comes up, but framebuffers are fucked.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: i'm of the opinion we should make any merges of the samsung source drops selective. a wholesale merge will only make it harder to track nexus-s and mainline android kernels, where we see updates *with usable history*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; recovery comes up tho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, starting to think the same.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; this just seems to me a lot of work to basically make our kernel hard to merge.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; was hoping that Samsung dropping GB source would mean it would "just" work if we added mtd and yaffs2 and our initramfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but no such luck.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; what is in their gb sources that we need so badly? what are we missing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I only really care about the mach-s5pv210 tree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the gpios.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since we still don't have sleep working completely.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as seen by the battery complaints.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'll also go into the sound ASoc for wm8994 and pull what we need.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; right, butthere we really just need to go over what *any* kernel for sgs shuts off on sleep, and make sure we do the same.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the rndis/ums seems to be implemented correctly now too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; which i thought TMC_Sherpa started already?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, but you already fixed that. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he has.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; crap, kid just woke up - back in a few</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I did - but will compare to theirs anyway. they also enable MTP</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I guess for kies or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I have gpio diffs in froyo land, working on lining things up with our source</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; in cm7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush_: whatever you do . . . remember that we have merges that are CM7 based as well. I think we've got recovery merged now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so maybe not important.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: well, i don't know if kies uses it, but stock fw also supports transfer of media files via mtp. i don't really care about that. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: gotcha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the rest of the folks on #cwr aren't really thinking of SGS as a CM7 phone . . . what with lagfix etc . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; signal to noise is a little low</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; i just want a way to fakeflash really</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wow . . . funny really, voodoo lagfix on gingerbread. funny and sad. Samsung really sucks donkeys.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we have to get param.lfs working . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or at least, our kernel reading the damn thing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; or some utility, anyway.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we can be completely clear of samsung issues related to file systems.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm hoping coolya comes back now that I'm coming to my senses and are just going to take pieces of Samsung gingerbread code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; rather than attempting to make it play nice with CM7 as is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; *am just going</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; which is not happening. SGX stuff is crazy weird.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush_: hate to ask - who looks at frameworks/base and system/vold?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful is sorry about any part he played in convincing you to throw work away ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; have a couple of pending merges on review related to mounting dual sd cards</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: i can look at that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; what has two sd cards?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, SGS with internal/external. we weren;t able to  mount external over USB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in CM7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; oh that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; i added support for that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; htc inc has internal external as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; you just need to use ro.additionalmounts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; grep for that in both</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no no - there's more.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; o</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; there was a vold change needed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because we share a major device</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; let me find the reviews.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; techmik - you have the links?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i was looking at where they were on the list as you asked =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush_: vold needed another #ifdef VOLD_EMMC_SHARES_DEV_MAJOR like it does in another place.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; otherwise it was going to the wrong partition.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; true, certain persons here can fetch links in less time than it takes me to remember that somebody linked it. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i have like 14 windows/tabs open =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, that's why I always ask techmik or Kaik541 rather than go look myself ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful doesn't really even know why VOLD_EMMC_SHARES_DEV_MAJOR is anything but default behavior - partitions are very much allowed to share a major device number with their disk.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; techmik67: ...that's all?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think that's the only pending merges at the moment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; everything else is SGS specific</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol... all the xda tabs = 1 window, code review window (lotsa F5), github window with all the tabs, twitter.....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we get these, I'm calling us good and send all SGS stuff upstream! ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: and get something solved re:param.lfs ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well yeah . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but that would be kernel doing it, so doesn't need the same reviews.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I didn't say "supported"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I realized that to be officially supported we need to "just work"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; tbh, it would be just plain nifty if we could fake up *just* the reservoir and param, and maybe boot, recovery partitions w/ tinyfsr and use samsung stl/bml on them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; could...could we *do* something like that, and still use mtd for the other partitions?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush_: we do have a question tho . . . say we are never able to do a first install of CM7 straight via a ROM Manager update. That make us forever unsupported?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: why cant you do it via RM&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: if we could, then we could just be in RM then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: why cant your zip work via RM is my question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush_: right now we have to install a new kernel that goes and converts all the filesystems etc to start using MTD devices</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: because coming from a stock kernel, you can't even use mtd/yaffs2, for one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; then we install a second update that does the real install.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; atinm: RM supports that :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: that's a happy thing for us to hear. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; wow... the xda users will be in love =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; yeah so dont tell them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; can you elaborate on the process a bit more</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; what exactly happens</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unhelpful, you do it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you understand that better than I do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; i dont need tehcnical details on how its converted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; just the genrael workflow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; 1. install a kernel that is running CWM 3.x; 2. install an update that backs up efs data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: afaik first boot w/ a mtd kernel just tries to mount the partitions as yaffs2, and they get formatted when they fail. the point is mainly that the kernel and the rest of the update must be in separate updates for the first install.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; then boot with custom initial kernel that converts to mtd/yaffs2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; Unhelpful: can you just say: package1.zip does the update</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; package2.zip does another CM install?&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; in the samerecovery session?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: no, because we can not write yaffs2 filesystems without booting a new kernel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; Unhelpful: derp yeah that makes sense.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; unless we work up a module to do mtd access to the onenand while tinyfsr/stl/bml are still in place...i guess *maybe* that might be possible?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; urk ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush_: so, what we can do in one go is to unpack a stage2 update, back up efs, and write the new kernel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the new kernel can format things as yaffs2, install th backed-up efs, and write the rest of th system files.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; with the new sammy-based kernel it resulted in bootloops mtd (?) and tinyfsr enabled at the same time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; so it likely would be difficult</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; don't want.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lets see if we can first try to figure a way without having to go that route.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; we could just use a custom kernel for the firstboot, with the "real" kernel in the second stage.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; ls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; frick'n window focus</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the firstboot kernel could just have a recovery initramfs w/ the init script modified to write instructions to /cache for recovery to install the second-stage update</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; supercurio is hogging koush right now. :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we need the two sd card reviews on gerrit already</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you'll have to get me up to speed on what koush is doing multistage. same idea as mine for froyo roms?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (I do like being able to build kernel as I'm building all of CM7 - but that's cause we on SGS are used to building our own kernels)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it just hit me - we're going to have most favored status with RM and clockworkmod since we're CM ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I'm going to not worry about what they're proposing doing (mostly because its too hard to keep up on cwr)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because everytime they say RFS, a brain cell dies somewhere.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: but we need to think about how we're going to support clean install for real via RM.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm going to take a break from samsung GB porting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because it is going nowhere. codeworkx has the right idea, go the other way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; pull in the pieces we need. and he's already started.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: yes, we do, but if it's a goal to have in-kernl initramfs go away, and that is *also* a mainline blocker, we need to work on both.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm going to leave the samsung_cm7_merge branch there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; for spare time hacking.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ah! now I get why 2 stage.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lol, so then we won't need to build the kernel . . . ok, finally caught up :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: yes, the idea is to use a prebuilt kernel w/ a stub initramfs, that only has enough in it to extract either the boot or recovery initramfs from after the kernel image, and then we can just build kernel when we update it, and use a binary kernel like every other target.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and the initramfs will be shoved in after the kernel image like in other phones?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the 2nd initramfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; probably not *precisely* like other phones, is what i expect.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; afaik they use boot.img, and it looks like that has a header before the actual kernel, and we need the actual kernel first, or no boot.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the bootloader bites us in the ass again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but close enough approximation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (what is the problem we're trying to solve tho . . . it is really that painful to have an in-kernel initramfs?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; is it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; guess now I should read what #cwr is talking about</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but yeah, not that big a deal. we could honestly just concatenate a boot and then recovery initramfs, w/ some marker that makes it clear that's what they are, and extract those.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, no other device does, and it means we *have to* build kernel to build a boot image.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes, that's what I was thinking. my extract scripts were using the gzip markers.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, 2 stage it is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; even better, since our kernel is lzma there shouldn't be false gzip markers ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; for now (until we're fully merged), I think higher priority is reading params</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since it flashes the froyo 2.x clockworkmod, except is doesn't reboot (because we dont/cant read param) - just all kinds of fail.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; almost painful to hear about.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; atinm, it doesn't actually "flash" anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it just puts a file named update.zip on the sd card</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, I know - but this guy was very upset with me because he couldn't flash it :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; then it must suck to be that stupid :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; maybe there needs to be a version check.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; i'm gonna treat these mtd samsungs as different phones</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; so you wont even see the normal SGS roms in your list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; great.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; so you can use RM</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; you mentioned saomething about resetting branches?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; or is there a way i can build without having to pull down the entire kernel....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; branches was just for me locally. you cna just build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you do need it tho .. sorry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we dont post a kernel image with initramfs into github</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; its basically the same process as building CM7 mainline</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush_&gt; there's none of that in in recovery that i can see</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we don't try to write to bml at all - they're mtd for us. <a href="http://pastie.org/1814797">http://pastie.org/1814797</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; is this from some other kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; yea, i working on support for bml retarded epic now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; support for yours is already done</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you could have said that earlier :) . . . techmik and unhelpful aren't talking, so I thought maybe you guys were debugging something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's great tho - I'm going to love having RM see MTD Captivate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: we still have a separate, unused, kernel-sized partition :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; too many users complain that "why does cyanogen not like SGS?" etc . . . they think we're going to be unsupported forever and every little bit helps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; Unhelpful: I try not to think about it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it does just sit there..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but it would have to be bootloader that says "boot to bml8 recovery"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and ours is an idiot.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: the same users who use hacked vendor roms and ask why anybody would want a "plain vanilla" like CM? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, I sometimes answer nicely and say "cyanogen doesn't like us"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or I'll say "it'll be supported when we're done and merged" but users understand the first more than the second ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I love our kernel dmesg "we have a crappy bootloader, wait for it"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's never coming out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, koush - going to leave you so I can get ready before kid wakes. before you crash, put our two review requests in your queue for when you wake up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (whichever time is easier for a review to pass ;-) )</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; whether just before you crash or after you wake again</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I added Steve to them myself, but he went away just as I did.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so no +1 from him.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; so what exactly IS the reason Cyanogen doesn't officially support SGS? :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; umm, until someone successfully implements it, not a whole lot Cyanogen can do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and that someone is us.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we're cyanogen . .. that's how cyanogenmod works. each device has a team that works on it. SGS is us.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; but if i check cyanogen official homepage there is no mention of official sgs support..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the final arbiters of what is CM is koush and steve, but we have to do it first and merge.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kang&gt; tbh once camera works better i don't rly care how official it is :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; once we're merged, then we'll talk.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; YeahRight: like I said - its not done yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you are here, what do you think we're doing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; atinm : are you somewhat close to merging then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; btw, you're not in the right channel yeahright.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you should be in #cmsgs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; i'm in there too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but to explain, we're the CM subproject team working on making CM7 for SGS phones.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; once we're done, we'll be official.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; first time installing CM7 on my SGS is on my todo list so sorry if my question was pretty basic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; i understand now..appreciate the explaining</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; until we're done, we won't.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; you guys mentioned param.lfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; the problem was that you cant boot into recovery with reboot recovery comand?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and you have to 3 finger it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; to get into bml8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right - the bootmode is written to params.lfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we never get to bml8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; are you guys using aosp init</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; or samsung init</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; our bootloader thinks it doesn't exist.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; aosp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; with mod, merged now I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; why not just write a boot flag to cache</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and have that decide whether to run init.rc or recovery rc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, there are two sources that can write that thing - kernel and bootloader.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:11]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* knowsnotmuch (~ashwinds@115.242.246.181) Quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; bootloader will always write to params.lfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; to /cache</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; forgte how samsung is supposed to boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; you are gonna make up your own boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; atinm : you got any timeframe for merging? i understand that even without the merge CM7 is already working pretty fine on a SGS?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; heres what i did for droid x atinm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; which you CANT replac eboot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lol . . . ok, I'm listening - I want to get this workign.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; this shoul wokr for you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; basically, when init starts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; check /cache for a ".fuckedup" file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; YeahRight: first rule of Cyanogenmod: you do not ask for ETAs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; if its not there, you boot into android</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and you write a .fuckedup file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; now, please - you really shouldn't be here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; now, when android boots, completely, you have a boot receiver that DELETES the .fuckedup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; that means you booted successfully</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; now, in the other scenario, if the file eixsts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; you run recovery.rc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and boot into recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; super hacky</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; but it work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; ie, if a roms fucked, it boots you into recovery automagically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and rom manager wil work as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and you can boot into recovery programatically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and you still have a bml8 fallback if you need 3 finger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; 3finger doesn't boot bml8. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;YeahRight&gt; atinm : i understand about ETA's..i meant it very generally. Maybe I should rephrase: is it correct CM7 for SGS is already working pretty good in its current state?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, 3 finger still wants to boot to bml - its the same as normal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it boots bml8 w/ the right bootmode= kernel parameter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; its the bloody 2 written to params.lfs that tells init that it wants to boot to recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; same kernel, read different .rc file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; bml8 is empty on aries phones except maybe epic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: does it write to param.lfs *and* pass the bootmode on kernel command line on 3finger, or does it only pass the command line?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; YeahRight: signal to noise.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; only command line from what I understand</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; npo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; param I mean</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; no, because we only check command line, and 3-finger works.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in fact . . . let me think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes, I was parsing the command line</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in that loop in init. let me bring up the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; erm, where is the code - my TAGS are screwed right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:18]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful imagines that what boot does is *read* the command line from param.lfs if there is one, write a normal boot there (because obviously something clears recovery/download mode set there), and passes that to the kernel, or else just the recovery bootmode if you 3-finger it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wow 422MB TAGS file.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:20]</span> <span class="irc-green">* knowsnotmuch (~ashwinds@59.97.73.5) has joined this channel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, init.c</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; import_kernel_cmdline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and then we look for a 2 in bootmode #ifdef BOARD_PROVIDES_BOOTMODE</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and it is from /proc/cmdline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so yes, I think you're right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hrm, actually, no, boot can't be doing anything to kernel command line in param.lfs, or we'd see the bootmode and recovery would work. ;/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; erm so about my suggestion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; to get around param.lfs :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think we could do it. if we can get our mind around how to get 3 finger to work as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since bootloader is still read/writing there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; what happens now on 3 finger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush: the kernel command line is modified, we read it from /proc/cmdline, and detect that recovery is requested.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I *think* bootloader writes a 2 in the bootmode parameter in /proc/cmdline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; ok, do you guys still have a concept of bml8?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; or is that all gone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no - it was never there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it has always been empty since Samsung ROM days.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; im not following then, 3 finger is working at the moemnt right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes . . . hrm.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; so... 3 finger boots you into recovery.rc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush: right, because init checks /proc/cmdline for bootmode=2, and runs recovery.rc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; OR /cache/.recovery mode file existing boots you into recovery.rc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; so you can use the latter programatically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and the prior physically.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes . . . we can do that I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; its not pretty</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; but it makes shit easier.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; let us hack around this a bit today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I have to go, unhelpful - you're going to be packing up soon too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; rather than trying to figure out how to write param.lfs , dont even bother, write somewhere else for your boot mode flag :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, it's 6:30am here. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; is my suggestion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; ok i gotta sleep</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; its 3:30</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, same.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; nite koush - dont' forget our reviews pls so we dont have to keep merging frameworks/base</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and system/vold</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; i will</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we can wait till you wake :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; bye - I'm off too. have to be ready for work before kid wakes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:28]</span> <span class="irc-green">* atinm is now known as atinm|away</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush: or check those conditions in a pre-init to decide which secondary initramfs to unpack? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; Unhelpful: eh nah, theres no need</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; i did something with epic today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; i put my second initramfs into /res/sbin and /res/etc</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as a side project, I'm still interested in us reading/writing params.lfs so we get download mode as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but not high priority . . . I am just as happy taking it out of the ROM as an option for shutdown</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; we need it for lpm mode to work, too, but yeah, it's a ways out :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so actual real projects for me and unhelpful are 2 stage initramfs and reboot into recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and compass.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and kernel merges. but I'm leaving kernel merges to codeworkx now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; codeworkx, new tactic. pull in Samsung GB kernel pieces as needed into our tree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; rather than trying to make the whole damn thing work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i'm very close there! i can taste it. it is delicious.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; something is very screwed in the GB kernel and I'm not going to just sit and waste time figuring .config.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if someone else wants to get it working for the phones we support, cool.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'll do the sound driver merge too and any other pieces I touched recently like USB mount</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but a whole replace of our kernel with samsung's is in many ways a step back because we'll just be fixing the same bugs again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so codeworkx, you're free to do what you started :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho of course, codeworkx is off in the weeds trying to support CM7 on top of bml</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; there are snakes in those weeds codeworkx.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; codeworkx: agreed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; sound is working, so no need</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we'll leave the merge we started in its branch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; not for captivate :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, not fully</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so it'll be nice to make sure we have everything correct by looking at galaxy s driver and comparing with nexus s</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; gpu yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; param we don't *have* to support if we do the workaround koush suggested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but good to have</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; for lpm too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we will do the workaround because its a quick and dirty</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; just my style ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but gpu and ril.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and any other low hanging fruit like sound. I do want to merge mach-s5pv210 tree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we get sleeps correct and might manage to fix battery issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; still a lot. but not a wholesale merge</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; one of the takeaways was that big land based casinos pushed this because they want the current companies out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so they can enter it themselves</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; after it is "legal" again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; which it will be . . . in the meantime, we're stuck and you get me fulltime on android :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; tho I really would like to be able to play again . . .</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; what to merge? what solves battery drain?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; for SGX. that sort of crap.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; oh, mach-s5pv210 would have the correct sleep settings for the gpios</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; codeworkx: stuff related to camera maybe? to fix quality issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; which we most probably missed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; kolja camery</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; in case I want to do something else. but can't find the thing that creates the initramfs by collecting the stuff from the device dirs etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; how about creating a param.prop (includes mountpoint), init reads content of param.prop, mounts the stuff, checks for .recovery and so on</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; coolya: the other thing is 2 stage initramfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so we have a kernel that is like the others, and ours then reads the 2nd stage from like a known offset.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; if kernel is broken some reason we can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; well, mostly not needed to build kernel all the time.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; it doesnt' solve any immediate needs tho</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; well, it would make our merge easier tho :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[17:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; because everyone won't need to also have sgs kernel in their tree</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I wanted to do minimal damage. we explicitly copy etc into misc there, so it is ok to remove etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; didnt' want to do more in case we add something else to misc we need . . . was easier ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; oh wait.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we are renaming there right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; not moving etc into /misc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; no, see, we actually move /etc *to* /misc right now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; exactly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we want to be renaming</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; correct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so /misc needs to be removed, else we end up doing move-into instead of rename.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; right, ok gotcha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; *or* we should change recovery.rc, and make sure /misc *does* exist, and move /etc under it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; btw, how did koush get at recovery.fstab last night?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; since the code is looking at /etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; we symlink /misc to /etc in recovery.rc</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; well, I have half a script for junk removal but my mac has a crap version of grep so it wont run....and whatever cc is on this POS has a broken LD so I can't even compile GNU grep to fix it.  one tiny step forward one giant leap backward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; on the other hand, the script evaluates all the IFDEF that are true (in the defconfig) so I only need to work out the false half which isn't that bad as long as I can come up with a good list for false</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; that will get rid of most of the garbage in the tree (commented out stuff is still a problem) so I can get good data to compare</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; just a quick glance here zachy_md|busy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; and one of the issues said it was byte 84?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; if you uncomment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; you can write it at kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; but you have to find out what to write and where</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yeah . ..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; that's what I'm worried about.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; we need more phones.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; and to find out i've mapped param to mtdblock8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; for when I start writing to it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; but you cannot kill param. if its fucked up it will be rewritten by sbl</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I guess odin can just write over it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so its fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; TMC_Sherpa you think it would make a big change merging stuff from it to the current sources ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; TMC_Sherpa I'm actually a bit at loss &amp; overwhelmed from all this change samsung introduced</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; going to look a little more into mounting /dev/block/mtdblock3 onto /cache early - maybe koush can point me at his droid code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; since he must have had to solve it too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; ping koush__</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; damn fast</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; ! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; hey koush, been trying to read /cache earlier than when we read init.rc etc in init. but the devices aren't available at that point (they become available after coldboot)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; TMC_Sherpa they added lots of powersaving stuff which doesn't seem to be used much right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so /dev/block/mtdblock3 (which is /cache for us) isn't there to mount.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; mnita|work: cant you dev wait</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; no clue, they added a bunch of stuff and changed some others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; TMC_Sherpa or at least seem to use it: clock gating, power gating and the didle mode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; yeah, way too much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; didn't work - coldboot is queued later, wait just waits for the timeout which always happens because coldboot won't run until later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; a git changelog would have been nice ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so there are dirtier and dirtier hacks we could do . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; preaching to the choir my friend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; like not reading recovery.rc/init.aries.rc until after coldboot . . . doing it from within init.rc by a new command etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; well, its not all that much I guess, the diff file is 529 lines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; so was wondering how you did it on droid. you wouldn't have the dev either.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; on droid x, i replaced teh logwrapped binary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; only things available that early are the initramfs things and /proc, /sys etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; which is called during init</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; and umounted everything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; to prevent android boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; and then booted recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; the logwrapper* binary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; urk :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; I'm thinking I shoudl jsut attack params.lfs and just get it to do what it should.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; yea gross</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; mnita|work: don't mount param as yaffs2. you'll get a lost+found folder on it xD</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; these guys were working on it zachy_md|busy but I haven't been to xda to check up on them in ages <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=784270">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=784270</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; so I don't know if they ever changed kernels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; no, I have to think about what I'll do . . . has anyone done any exploration of what that format is?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; is it just another fat derivative?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; can you read it at all?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; right now no - haven't tried, haven't mapped it to anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;nitam|work&gt; it'll show up as /dev/block/mtdblock8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i *thought* unhelpful said param was j2fs? maybe?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; why not do a mtd read against that and see what u get</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; you can mount it ext2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush__&gt; or does that corrupt it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; there he is =)</span><br />
