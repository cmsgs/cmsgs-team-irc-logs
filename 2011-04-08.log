<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|away: on linux box it's going to depend on your distribution and configuration. dmesg should show an RNDIS device attached. whether or not your system configures and uses it is something else. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sixstringsg&gt; nullghost: go talk to eXistZ over in #suckerpunch. He's been doing a lot of clockwork stuff recently.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also i think 179:8 is quite appropriate to export, isn't that the whole-disk device for ext_sd?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; gimme sec, some idiot, could be any idiot,  left everything he did today at work and is trying to recreate it as fast as possible</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Sure, I'm here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; and seeing as some other idiots like to define the same frick'n thing in multiple files I'm trying to clean this list up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; OK, I'm catching up with all the action from yesterday's logs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; hmmm.... why is this hub so bad on upload speed? networks are bidirectional......</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; or I could keep going on the captivate and just make you do all of it on the vibrant... in fact I think I will.  bee arr bee smokey</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; OK, sure. I'm new to development so it could be rough in the beginning. But I'll catch up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; what I have in mind isn't very hard, just kinda time consuming</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; OK, I'm game.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; which kernel sources do you have at the moment?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; What cloud based storage options do you guys recommend?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I was looking at tarsnap. From the logs, I got to know about clouddrive and it sure looks interesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I have a website I don't do anything with, so I just chuck stuff up there but I think most of the guys are using dropbox</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I did a repo sync on 28th</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; 2.6.35 -- :) do you need any more information than that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; well, we're looking for gpio differences between the vibrant and captivate at the moment, so the sammy 2.2 sources for those two will come in handy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Yup, I have froyo 2.2 for Vibrant as well (and 2.1 as well, should it come handy)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I have some skeleton directories that make things easier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; or you could make your own, you have all the build tools to make a kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; and some free disk space?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I have about 100G free space</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; heh I have like 28 so that should be plenty :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* TMC_Sherpa should have set up a much larger linux partition</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I did a successful build after the repo sync. So, yes, the tools to build kernel are there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I hardly had any space or so I thought. When I investigated the disk, I found that I had a cool 133G tucked away for the rainy day. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; heh for some reason I had 4 2gb swap partitions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; which when you only get asside 50g for linux is a pretty large percentage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; ok</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; untar KA6 twice, I renamed the directorys to noduild and t959_skeleton but whatever</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; then comes the tricky bit, wait like 15 min before you build in the skeleton directory, when your done you use -amin in the find command to figure out which files are used in the build and what ones are just dead weight for a vibrant</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Ah, that's neat! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; well, once you have a skeleton looking up gio or anything else become much easier 'cus your only looking at 4K files or less rather than 15 or whatever is in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I could find out, gimme a sec</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; only 4k vs 15k otherwise -- sweet! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; 3589 in my skeleton vs 31398</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; makes diff run just a bit faster :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; diff is only done against the files returned for find -amin?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; find . -amin -(whatever time you want) -type f &gt;&gt; ../some_file_name will spit out every file that was used for the build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; you build in skel, grab a list of the files that got touched, nuke everything in the skel then copy the files back over from no_build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; from the list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; ok, gotcha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; unless one of you smart people in here has a better way of doing it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I assume your running some flavor of linux?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Yes, Ubuntu here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I just follow instructions in the README included, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; "make T959_rev05_defconfig"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; that part will work yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; the cross compile may be more entertaining depending how you have your path set up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; 10.10 (or earlier I guess) or 11.4?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Ubuntu 10.10</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Anything else I should setup?</span><br />
