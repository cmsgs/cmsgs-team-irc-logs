<span class="irc-date">[2:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; OK, sure. I'm new to development so it could be rough in the beginning. But I'll catch up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; what I have in mind isn't very hard, just kinda time consuming</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; OK, I'm game.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; which kernel sources do you have at the moment?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; What cloud based storage options do you guys recommend?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I was looking at tarsnap. From the logs, I got to know about clouddrive and it sure looks interesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I have a website I don't do anything with, so I just chuck stuff up there but I think most of the guys are using dropbox</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I did a repo sync on 28th</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; well, we're looking for gpio differences between the vibrant and captivate at the moment, so the sammy 2.2 sources for those two will come in handy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Yup, I have froyo 2.2 for Vibrant as well (and 2.1 as well, should it come handy)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I have some skeleton directories that make things easier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; or you could make your own, you have all the build tools to make a kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; and some free disk space?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I have about 100G free space</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I did a successful build after the repo sync. So, yes, the tools to build kernel are there.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; I hardly had any space or so I thought. When I investigated the disk, I found that I had a cool 133G tucked away for the rainy day. :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; then comes the tricky bit, wait like 15 min before you build in the skeleton directory, when your done you use -amin in the find command to figure out which files are used in the build and what ones are just dead weight for a vibrant</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[3:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; lol k, delete the skel directory and lets try that again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I usually wait 15 min or so after I guild the directory so I know there is a big window between when the files were created and when the build accessed them</span><br />
