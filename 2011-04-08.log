<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|away: on linux box it's going to depend on your distribution and configuration. dmesg should show an RNDIS device attached. whether or not your system configures and uses it is something else. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sixstringsg&gt; nullghost: go talk to eXistZ over in #suckerpunch. He's been doing a lot of clockwork stuff recently.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also i think 179:8 is quite appropriate to export, isn't that the whole-disk device for ext_sd?</span><br />
