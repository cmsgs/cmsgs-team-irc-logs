<span class="irc-date">[1:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: i really can't carry so many repo clones around, especially since repo is not even close to as flexible as git about sharing data.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; hoping to cut the whole thing back down once we have some semblance of order!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm waiting for coolya to call success :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I think codeworkx right now has the latest stuff for gingerbread.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I will clone all that (or add it to branches on the current stuff)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I've been off in the weeds today - fighting with ext4 and backup/restore</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko_&gt; Unhelpful: did you try my kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; coolya seemed to imply that the bootloader actually understood mtd - but I am not sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, gotta go - dang it, weekend over.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-green">* atinm is now known as atinm|night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|night: but, understands *how*? i understand we only need to write the kernel in the appropriate range, but i don't see any way around the use of j4fs to pass parameters - how will the bootloader know what to do if we use yaffs etc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; gdanko_: is it possible you've imported some bits from somebody else's repo that weren't merged into cmsgs? i suspect such a possibility because it looked like there were alsa errors when i attempted a call.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko_&gt; no i used the cmsgs repo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hrm :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; thedood: so to fix the gps-crashes-system_server i need to use the gps-nmea components i see in some of the other device repositories?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko_&gt; Unhelpful: does it nt boot?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; Unhelpful: I dunno - how does nexus s do it? that bootloader gets mtd I guess?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; or can we not leave param in j4fs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; but I actually don't know - I've been waiting for coolya to enlighten me :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; Unhelpful: I can't make reorient kernel boot even :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I'm going in reverse.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; then I reflashed my phone, and turned out Android Market was missing after I went to stock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; even though Vending.apk was in /system/app</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; it's been that kind of day</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; going to shower and bed . . . so I can wake up early enough to get to the gym.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; night!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko_&gt; tomorrow i will put linux 64 on my work box so i can build GB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;gdanko_&gt; and in 1:07 i will commit my xcal kernel changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|night: i don't know how nexus s does it, but obviously we're restricted to what *our* bootloader knows.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i don't know how we can leave param in j4fs and still use mtd, doesn't j4fs rely on stl/bml?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; what's param anyway?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;thedood&gt; maan</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; thedood: for one thing, reboot appears to stick the kernel command line there before shutting down - this is how reboot recovery / reboot download work.</span><br />
