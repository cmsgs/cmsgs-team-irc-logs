<span class="irc-date">[2:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; emailed the samsung contact re: yas529 docs/code. i hope we can *at least* get formal permission for the team to use and build from their sensor daemon code, that would be a big help even if we can't get open code. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; nice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if it works, nice. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; seriously, if we could just get code for the sensor daemons with permission to distribute only binaries, and some help to make sure it works correctly, that would be very, very nice. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:59]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful would *rather* open-source code we can integrate directly into CM, but will settle for a solution that works and lets us fix issues ourselves.</span><br />
