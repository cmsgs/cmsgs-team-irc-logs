<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, obviously tracking, or computing on, too many sample points is going to get expensive. maybe just track the last N most recent points, drop new ones if they're too close to the last measurement (hence not useful), and replace the oldest one when a new one is accepted? any time a measurement is accepted, recalculate bias.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; Good evening folks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; didnt see ya =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* dasunsrule32_ (~dasunsrul@christiantechsaz.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; Unhelpful: dang, I should have talked to our friend at dinner . . .  now they're all talking medical stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; hi :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; he would know where/how to do the points to surface of sphere stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; 3 PhDs (one MD/PhD) . . . I'm hiding in the study.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kang&gt; talk to them about derp.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|sick: i have that part working, in python, with numpy.linalg for my solver. rewriting in C++/TNT :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I just try not to embarass myself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and as part of a model for tracking inputs and updating the estimated bias.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (wife kicks me under the table when I start to get stupid)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; have to soak my foot now . . . it hurts.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (its funny, they're more impressed by me working on Android . . . its "real")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; atinm|sick: lol!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (their work is very research oriented - tho one is a world class radiation oncologist too, she's in a different league_</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; all three are harvard medical school, so I actually know where I really stand</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; so I talk a teeny bit of Android, then shut up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and their stuff is not "real"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; a lot of it is future oriented, not in active use</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; mostly in trials and things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; not the radiation oncologist of course - she's my wife's partner in her research - wife is the technical one, she's the clinical one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; and she a rain maker for the hospital (brings in the most money for the hospital)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; but they still get impressed by me working on Android - or maybe they are just being nice to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I know when to shut up :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (or am told when to . . .)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; anyway, hopefully be feeling better by tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I went back and deleted my A1026 changes - they're much too confusing and random things stop workign</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; too many random bits in random registers with names like DACL_BLAH</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; now we just pray source gets released - only way we're getting A1026</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; or TMC_Sherpa makes some headway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; and I get encouraged and attack it again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I *really* would like to work on uBoot tho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; hope we are able to get a broken phone to play with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I'll look in the code in our repo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; see what it does - we do have the processor documentation to start with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; off for the night. chaembian you get to play with git and installing zips you created yourself today :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; hopefully will have something for you to try tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; for headset</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-green">* atinm|sick is now known as atinm|night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; atinm|night: I did that yesterday :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful wishes his build system didn't have sshd off :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but i really really really can't reasonably build on the system i'm hacking code on right now (1.6GHz Atom dual-core + HT, 1GB RAM)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; BiasModel.cpp compiles! :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; that *sounds* lime a good thing =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; like*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; techmik67: it's not complete yet... so far it has a class for modelling sensor bias, which can initialize itself, and has a member that can add a data point, and returns whether or not a new estimate is possible after adding the new data point.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i've sent some raw sensor data over to my NAS. with luck i can get as far as having a test harness for this thing tonight, and run that through it.</span><br />
