<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and he just had his 100th base hit (a base hit is a run in cricket)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; (and you don't leave until you get out)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; out!!!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i *had* been curious how the scores were so obscenely large compared to baseball. aside from them not being much alike at all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; its because a base hits counts as a run, and batsmen don't leave until they get out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; so you get to keep batting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and running, and scoring. got it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; even if you hit a home run (a ball out of the field without it touching the field) it only counts as 6 runs and you keep batting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; a ball you hit out of the field, but with at least one bounce on the field counts as 4 runs, and you keep batting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; outs are if you are struck out, caught (same as baseball)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and run out when you don't get safe during running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; do you actually have to run the bases in such cases? it seems relevant imo because eventually exhaustion would impair your ability to hit the ball clear of the field.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; except that struck out is a one shot deal - you protect 3 sticks behind you, if the ball hits them, you're out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; you don't have to run for the 6 and 4 run, but you do run the others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and the world cup right now is each side getting to face the same number of pitches</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; whoever scores more</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; wins</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; so you want to hit and run on each pitch really</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; preferably out of the park</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; but if not, then at least a base hit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and it is the finals, india vs sri lanko</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; sri lanka, and they're batting</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and even though India has the best batsmen in the world</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; pressure is pressure</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; India has to score 275 in 50 overs (or 400 pitches) to win</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; those numbers seems way too large</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; like I was saying :) - a basehit is a run.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and you don't leave until you get out. out == strike out (balls don't count), run out on bases, catch out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; so you can keep hitting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; wow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; an inning is every batter gets to bat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Kaik541: he already explained, scroll up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; or 400 pitches are done</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful, yeah, I was reading</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but he's explaining again too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so reading both :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; (there is a break on)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and oh, you're allowed to hit 360 degrees around the batter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; not just in front</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; so batters have more options</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; pitchers change (one doens't pitch 400 :) )</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; there is a pitching change every 8 pitches, but then the pitcher who just finished, can come back to pitch another 8 after the second pitcher has pitched 8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; 8 pitches == over. a pitcher pitches an over, then another pitches an over and then the first can come back to pitch another 8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; A bowler can bowl 10 overs at the maximum</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; ah yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; (I was trying not to make it too complicated ;) )</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; There are 6 balls to a over</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; basketball is easier =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; 6? ah yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; it is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; but cricket fans easily become baseball fans</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and vice versa.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; requires the same sort of appreciation :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; similar sorts of rules, some seem weird until you have seen it in play</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; same sorts of battles between pitchers and batters</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and now it looks like India will lose the world cup in Mumbai. they have to bat really well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; to win</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; urk.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; my dad must be quite stressed at home right now :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; maybe I should call them :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; oh, and it really is a world cup ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; how many countries played chaembian ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; Your dad follows cricket too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; of course, he's in India still</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; Ah!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; nice, 17 countries played. down to India and Sri Lanka now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; India beat Australia in the quarters, Pakistan in the semis.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; so they've already played the finals in the semis :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; Yeah, India's been fighting well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; ok, off for a bit. Indian inning starting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; Was it 17? I checked Wiki and it said 14.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; (I have not watched the other matches, I'm watching only this)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; sorry, meant to type 14</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; shit</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; (one of the better batsmen out second pitch . . .)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; guess I should look at the review</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; ok, we just need to do our merges</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and go back to using additionalmounts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and we're good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i just synced</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; we need to change something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; do we still need the vold changes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; no</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; no, just use the repo sync</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and modify cyanogen_captivate.mk and change removablemounts to additionalmounts</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; so we need to change additional mounts manually, or are you reversing the commit? =)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; it isn't big change and is make sense imho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; maybe they want to hold it till cm7.1 because they are in late RCs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; at least tell us then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; and don't they cut a branch where they do RCs from?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; its all on head?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; if i will get any info it will tell</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; normaly it is head</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; ok . . . but it isn't a big change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; they can just try it and see if it works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; it will either work, or not work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; not some subtle code change</span><br />
