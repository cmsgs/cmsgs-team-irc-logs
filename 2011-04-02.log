<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, obviously tracking, or computing on, too many sample points is going to get expensive. maybe just track the last N most recent points, drop new ones if they're too close to the last measurement (hence not useful), and replace the oldest one when a new one is accepted? any time a measurement is accepted, recalculate bias.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; Good evening folks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; hi</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* dasunsrule32_ (~dasunsrul@christiantechsaz.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; Unhelpful: dang, I should have talked to our friend at dinner . . .  now they're all talking medical stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; hi :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; he would know where/how to do the points to surface of sphere stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; 3 PhDs (one MD/PhD) . . . I'm hiding in the study.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kang&gt; talk to them about derp.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|sick: i have that part working, in python, with numpy.linalg for my solver. rewriting in C++/TNT :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I just try not to embarass myself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and as part of a model for tracking inputs and updating the estimated bias.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (wife kicks me under the table when I start to get stupid)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; have to soak my foot now . . . it hurts.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (its funny, they're more impressed by me working on Android . . . its "real")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian&gt; atinm|sick: lol!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; (their work is very research oriented - tho one is a world class radiation oncologist too, she's in a different league_</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; all three are harvard medical school, so I actually know where I really stand</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; so I talk a teeny bit of Android, then shut up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and their stuff is not "real"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; a lot of it is future oriented, not in active use</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; mostly in trials and things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; not the radiation oncologist of course - she's my wife's partner in her research - wife is the technical one, she's the clinical one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; and she a rain maker for the hospital (brings in the most money for the hospital)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; but they still get impressed by me working on Android - or maybe they are just being nice to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|sick&gt; I know when to shut up :)</span><br />
