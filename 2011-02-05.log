<span class="irc-date">[7:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; Hey guys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I don't know if you saw,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I have a team organized to develop the Captivate ROM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; talk to atinm, he has some experience with the cap</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I just outlined bugs and fixes we have on another channel; We have the kernel reoriented (but that was part of the source), we have the headset jack fixed from my commit earlier. There was a bug in the headset jack that I found in coolya's git that I have yet to commit. For bugs, we have the obvious bugs that are already known, and we also have the fact that the kernel doesn't compile with the reorientations (#if, #else).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; coolya: I made an error in my code; at line 282 in sec_jack.c, there needs to be a semicolon before return 0;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; oh I see, I will fixit</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[8:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; I also need to fix vold.fstab. One other interesting thing to note: The Captivate has the same chip as the Nexus 1 for noise canceling. The only driver availible is in Rogers 2.1 source.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[8:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ytt3r&gt; That's it for me, I'll be back tomorrow (late tonight for you guys :p)</span><br />
