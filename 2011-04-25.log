<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful had a backup from tuesday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but still unable to boot kernels i'm building :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; =(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, so, i won't have anything for you to test until this is sorted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also lost all of my angry birds easter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; techmik67: everybody thinks radio == wifi.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i see that =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; have you seriously not noticed people come here *ALL THE TIME* thinking that a new radio has solved, or might solve, some wifi issue?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; it still amazes me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; techmik67 oh - didn't you know - when you flash certain radio versions you'll get better WIFI power management ? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; and my camera will work =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; hehe - yeah, don't know why everybody thinks that WIFI is connected with radio</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, because wifi is a radio technology? unlike cell phones. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; maybe i'll get some CM work done tonight. because sadly it was a myth that the second dr who this season was airing a day after the first. which would've been good to do when openning w/ a two-parter.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful flashes JVB radio to see if it fixes the compass ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; funny</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; some guy agrees that "this rom is getting better everyday". and his uglyass sig has a huge image with cognition4 on it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; why do ppl have sigs with big graphics...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ilke anyone cares what they're running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; especially if it isn't even accurate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush, should I be joining some other channel where pershoot, josh and others are?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in case this needs us to be in the same place</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; this has to be something harmony specific, it is wrong as it is - it can't share two devices if there is only one lun known</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so it must have had two, now there is one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I think failure is making MountService/Vold get into a state where it thinks things are mounted when some other part thinks it isn't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; of course, we can also revert this change.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; things still work for us without it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but the bug isn't here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and if I had a harmony, I'd be able to find it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush: which kernel source tree does harmony use?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; Unhelpful :) both are radio technologies - but the more often I read this the more I believe in this connection ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; it would be interesting who came up with this strange relationship</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; zacharias|busy: that's yours: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=13173957&amp;postcount=3240">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=13173957&amp;postcount=3240</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and the one before, but the guy is not very adb saavy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so he never posts a dmesg or /proc/last_kmsg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (I was diplomatic, I realized that more and more ppl are reading the logs now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; cloning cm-kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; to see if I can figure out what is wrong with harmony by inspection</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; atinm thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; atinm I haven't played around with gpiolib</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; so it might be related to the cm7-gb-source merge ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt;  WARNING: at drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:103 gpio_ensure_requested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; the rest is in that log</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; besides that app seems to be getting killed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; what merge?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; sigkill</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we haven't released anything with a merge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, some things have been pulled in - is that what you mean?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; changes starting from commit: 0865fc2b728b5b926df4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; since april 18th</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I dunno, the people reporting these seem to be using other kernels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; mainly the commits that codeworkx added</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I haven't been paying attention</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; zacharias|busy: whaaaaaaaaaaaaat cellular phones are radios?! that's crazy talk! ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; those sigkills probably are due to the OS rebooting while the kernel is staying up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; Unhelpful newer had thought that - great thing you reminded me of it ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; next you'll be telling me gps uses radio too!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; oh - does it ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; (actually people already think modem impacts that as well)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; zacharias|busy: haven't looked at the kmsg. it is zipped, too much work for a image that isn't mine ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; atinm oh well ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; atinm but it seems to be related to your stuff and at the very end a bug seems to be exposed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; "unable to handle paging request"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; that could simply be memory exhaustion, couldn't it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; hm, my kernel has the OOM rewrite from 2.6.36 and other related fixes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; so I doubt it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; but yes, could be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since yours in the only one giving these reboots, I'd say one of the other changes you've put in are to blame.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; kang's isn't from what I can tell</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; k</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; I'll have have a closer look then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; the strange thing is: that kernel isn't supposed to work on captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; keys are reported to not work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; so why does the bug-report in the 1st place</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; weird :\</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that came from the vibrant thread</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; ah - i see</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; ok, seems like I found the culprit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I am uploading both vibrant and captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I keep track of both</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; thanks for the report,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; let's see if reverting it will help with stability ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; reverting *the patch (potentially) causing this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; this 2 sdcard mount thing is such a pain.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the bug is on harmony, but I feel responsible.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; someone needs to tell him which arch harmony is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I assume mach-msm.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but which board/device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-incrediblec.c:	.nluns		= 3,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/devices_htc.c:	.nluns = 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-supersonic.c:	.nluns		= 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-halibut.c:	.nluns = 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-msm7x30.c:	.nluns		= 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-mahimahi.c:	.nluns		= 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-swordfish.c:	.nluns		= 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ./arch/arm/mach-msm/board-bravo.c:	.nluns		= 1,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; from what I can tell, only incrediblec has more than one shareable mount.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; unless the others have their own kernel trees.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; like we do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful is effectively dead as a dev until he sorts out why he can't build a kernel that will boot...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wth . . . from our repo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I just built.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; clean too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: yeah, but um, from weeks ago. guess i need to stash and update. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:18]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful wonders if it's some sort of weird environment issue... just rebooted, so will clean, stash, sync, build. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; even though my only local changs are the sensors work, and some debug in the yas529 driver</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I hope.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; techmik67: have you built recently?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; not since this morning... should i?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; nah, wait to see what unhelpful has</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I just built.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I think the repo is fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:22]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful imagines this is local</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I lost my poker playing time to harmony debugging.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; dang.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lol, ok - he got it working after he got the kernel to know that he needs 2 luns</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I'm off the hook :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; looks like its working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; no time for any poker tournaments now tho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so, any high priority bugs to fix on galaxys? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:46]</span> <span class="irc-green">* TMC_Sherpa (~jeff@c-67-173-42-196.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined this channel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; these people are insane. they'll call down to the river holding 4c,2s</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; who does that?!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; people who don't know how to play?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but 4 of clubs and 2 of spades! down to the river in the face of a raise.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; do they think someone is playing like 3c, 2s?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and raising?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; jeez.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I shouldnt complain . . . I can take money off these ppl.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; wish I was in this game :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I assumed you were talking about a card game.  Other than that I have no idea what your talking about :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the funny part is, it is only level 2 with blinds at 10/20. and they're already down to 5 players out of 10</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; meaning at least 5 idiots decided to go all in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in the very first rounds.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah, poker. online</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; some sites are still up for us players</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; these were smaller than the big 3.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so the players here are not as good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho people are coming here now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so it'll get tougher.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if I can spot mistakes, there will be real sharks coming by soon.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since I'm a guppy myself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho it seems I'm a bigger guppy than I thought.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and can eat these smaller guppys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; off to bed. salivate over some wins tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if I am able to play.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; d</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; dont' anyone come up with new bugs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; everything works fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you always say that. and then I come back and there is always something waiting for me!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; good night :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; FIRSTBOOT. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; YAY!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* techmik67 was hoping....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; first boot off repo or first boot off 2 initramfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; (remembered I needed to test something related to mounts)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol, wb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; define "2" ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it's the firstboot of a mkshbootimg kernel. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; well, how about, load small initramfs that will then eventually load the secondary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; awesome :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I am *still* going to bed tho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, that's just it, a small initramfs is embedded in the kernel, that we only need to change when we want to change how that works.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; what did I tell you atinm, its working.  everything is fine :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; gooo toooo sleeeep</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so you get to use techmik to test :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; don't make me sing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; yup...i'll be here to test, go to sleep =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I want to test one more thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and if it fails, I won't tell anyone.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and go to bed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the "real" initramfs is attached after the kernel - everything lives under /stage1, the script dumps the boot partition there w/ bml_over_mtd, then looks for the horrible ascii header i... i can't even call it "designed' :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; under the heading of what you don't know won't hurt you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it's "\n\n\BOOT_IMAGE_OFFSETS\nboof_offset=...;boot_len=...;recovery_offset=...;recovery_len=...\n" :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it can be extracted, from the binary image of the kernel partition, w/ busybox grep ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; hey, it works that way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yeah, good enough for govt work. or was that open source work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; personally I think its very cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; glad koush pushed us</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the kernel, header, and initramfs are padded to 512b boundaries so that we can use blocks instead of bytes for the offset/length</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; anything we can come up w/ reasonable binary or script to test for can be done in stage1, so if we want to look for /cache/.startrecovery or something, we can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; that sounds like as good a name as any</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; tho I was thinking start.recovery so it is always seen in ls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if we hack up a binary to look in param.lfs for things, we can put the binary in stage1... but i think we should treat param.lfs as read-only, and only look there to see if bootloader has started in lpm or such.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; tho you can't push until it is all working :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I guess you can push to a branch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yes, I think that's fine - easier to read than write params.lfs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; we can use /cache for our own reboot/recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; tho lpm.rc is another stupid addition to init</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; that no one will like.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; but I've never actually looked inside that file, don't even know what it does</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; <a href="http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/data.cpio">http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/data.cpio</a> is my current stage1, <a href="http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/mkshbootimg.py">http://looking-glass.us/~chshrcat/mkshbootimg.py</a> is the script to attach, run w/o args for usage.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; all i've done *now* is build a regular kernel w/ data.cpio as the initramfs, and attach our current combined boot/recovery to it w/ mkshbootimg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; you need to gzip the attached ramdisk btw ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; will look tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|night: afaik all it does is get loaded if we start in lpm mode.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; test worked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; what do *normal* phones do on plug-when-off?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; (wanted to make sure not having an external sd didn't break mount service! :) )</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; I have no idea, my blackberry didn't stay off</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; wife's goes into like clock mode - just shows a clock</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; but this is the only android phone I have experience with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and it is only distantly related to android as it is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, i meant other android phones.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; koush is the one who knows most about them - he could tell us what is supposed to happen when a phone is plugged in but not on. what part if any of the kernel starts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; do they just turn on?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; atinm|night: lpm.rc is low power mode right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, our kernel boots, we don't have a choice there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; htc has something similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; my captivate used to just charge...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; they boot the device</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and go into a weird recovery mode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; and enable charging</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yes, lpm.rc seems to be low power mode. it is a different mode for booting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; the weird mode shows a battery charging status</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; anyway, whatever we decide to do, we have full scripting in stage1, so we can just replace init.rc w/ lpm.rc ourselves before starting init. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; its a phone off charge mode right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; koush: normal android phones don't do phone-off charge, they just boot?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; Unhelpful: I think we could make a commit to init that has BOARD_HAS_LPM_MODE in it that loads lpm.rc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; when asked.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; tho how asked ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; Unhelpful: htc boots into another type of recovery mode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; but yeah, they basically boot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;koush&gt; some phones just stay off i think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; ok, so do we - but we need to do then run the lpm.rc somehow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ours would bootloop if we tried to do that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|night: again, full scripting, we don't need to modify init, just the .rc. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; yes, I know. we can go at it two ways now :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; koush, unhelpful has the basic scripting working now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; so we should be able to load whichever initramfs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and with that, I'm off :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm|night: haven't written a script to *do* that yet, but yah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and i'm off to bed also</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:58]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* TMC_Sherpa will believe it when he sees it :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; lol, he'll have it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; just needs another of his all night sessions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I'm talking about you two actually leaving and going to sleep</span><br />
