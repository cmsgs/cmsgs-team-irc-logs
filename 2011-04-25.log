<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful had a backup from tuesday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; but still unable to boot kernels i'm building :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; =(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, so, i won't have anything for you to test until this is sorted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also lost all of my angry birds easter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; techmik67: everybody thinks radio == wifi.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i see that =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; have you seriously not noticed people come here *ALL THE TIME* thinking that a new radio has solved, or might solve, some wifi issue?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; it still amazes me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; techmik67 oh - didn't you know - when you flash certain radio versions you'll get better WIFI power management ? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; and my camera will work =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; hehe - yeah, don't know why everybody thinks that WIFI is connected with radio</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; well, because wifi is a radio technology? unlike cell phones. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; maybe i'll get some CM work done tonight. because sadly it was a myth that the second dr who this season was airing a day after the first. which would've been good to do when openning w/ a two-parter.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful flashes JVB radio to see if it fixes the compass ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; funny</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; some guy agrees that "this rom is getting better everyday". and his uglyass sig has a huge image with cognition4 on it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; why do ppl have sigs with big graphics...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ilke anyone cares what they're running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; especially if it isn't even accurate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush, should I be joining some other channel where pershoot, josh and others are?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; in case this needs us to be in the same place</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; this has to be something harmony specific, it is wrong as it is - it can't share two devices if there is only one lun known</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so it must have had two, now there is one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I think failure is making MountService/Vold get into a state where it thinks things are mounted when some other part thinks it isn't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; of course, we can also revert this change.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; things still work for us without it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but the bug isn't here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and if I had a harmony, I'd be able to find it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; koush: which kernel source tree does harmony use?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; Unhelpful :) both are radio technologies - but the more often I read this the more I believe in this connection ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; it would be interesting who came up with this strange relationship</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; zacharias|busy: that's yours: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=13173957&amp;postcount=3240">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=13173957&amp;postcount=3240</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and the one before, but the guy is not very adb saavy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so he never posts a dmesg or /proc/last_kmsg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (I was diplomatic, I realized that more and more ppl are reading the logs now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; cloning cm-kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; to see if I can figure out what is wrong with harmony by inspection</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; atinm thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; atinm I haven't played around with gpiolib</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; so it might be related to the cm7-gb-source merge ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt;  WARNING: at drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:103 gpio_ensure_requested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; the rest is in that log</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; besides that app seems to be getting killed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; what merge?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; sigkill</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we haven't released anything with a merge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, some things have been pulled in - is that what you mean?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; changes starting from commit: 0865fc2b728b5b926df4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; since april 18th</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I dunno, the people reporting these seem to be using other kernels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; mainly the commits that codeworkx added</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I haven't been paying attention</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; zacharias|busy: whaaaaaaaaaaaaat cellular phones are radios?! that's crazy talk! ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; those sigkills probably are due to the OS rebooting while the kernel is staying up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; Unhelpful newer had thought that - great thing you reminded me of it ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; next you'll be telling me gps uses radio too!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; oh - does it ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; (actually people already think modem impacts that as well)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zacharias|busy&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; zacharias|busy: haven't looked at the kmsg. it is zipped, too much work for a image that isn't mine ;-)</span><br />
