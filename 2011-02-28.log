<span class="irc-date">[13:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so, we're not incorporating the vendor video decoder libraries because of patent concerns? we include software avc/aac decoders, those aren't really *less* of a problem. :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; seems so Unhelpful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; but h.264 does seem to have stricter licensing terms</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Wout`: they're a real pain, but we're more in the clear for using the software decoder.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; but still, haven't SGS owners paid for those when they bought the phone? couldn't we come up with a method that adds the codecs seperately? like google apps?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; at the very least i think we need to support people building their own w/ the vendor binaries.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; I'd be happy to just extract the needed files from a samsung rom, and then push them to my phone running CM7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; I paid for both software and hardware, so I think I have the right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; sounds right to me too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; I love the fact that I download a 720p mkv and watch it on either my htpc or phone without transcoding</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; btw, any idea if 1080p decoding would work with the current chip of the SGS?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; It would be awesome if that could also be incorporated into CM...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; nah, doesnt have the power</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: why? it doesn't have any HD outputs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; 480P widescreen is the best it can display, and it's not like it even genuinely has 480 rows. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; Unhelpful: would it be difficult to get the samsung binaries to work on CM7?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, still, it's tedious to have to convert movies from one format to another</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'd like to be able to get 1080 clips onto the phone and play them like they are, without having to wait a couple of hours to decode them first...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; Unhelpful: the upcoming GB update from samsung will contain codecs that are compiled for Gingerbread, could those be merged with CM7?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: get a better computer? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, I have a Core I5 with 4GB of ram and a SSD to back that all up. If that's not good I don't now what is...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; evaluate: ... i7? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ohh, common</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I7 is overrated :p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; disagree, but then mine is also sandy bridge ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; also, it would cost me a fortune in a laptop (I don't have desktop computers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; SB i5 seems generally on par with or better than prior i7 by the specs though.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Also, I'm not sure if the difference in video encoding/decoding would be THAT huge...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; So my point stands. It would be awesome to have 1080p decryption on the SGS :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; erm, it should be reasonably close to linear vs clock :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and cores if you'd be upgrading from two to four</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; evaluate: get an SGS II :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, I5 also has 4 cores</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; interesting, WP doesn't list mobile 4-core i5s... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_microprocessors">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_microprocessors</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if you're thinking of HT logical cores, they don't really count for so much. i don't think of my i7 as being 8-core.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Might be that two of the cores are virtual ones. I've heard something like that before, didn;t get much into it tbqh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; 2 cores. says right there. ;)</span><br />
