<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I7 is overrated :p</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; erm, it should be reasonably close to linear vs clock :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; and cores if you'd be upgrading from two to four</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if you're thinking of HT logical cores, they don't really count for so much. i don't think of my i7 as being 8-core.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Might be that two of the cores are virtual ones. I've heard something like that before, didn;t get much into it tbqh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; 2 cores. says right there. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, always used this to get the number of cores: <a href="http://pastebin.com/unuRXv0g">http://pastebin.com/unuRXv0g</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; guess that doesn't fly with modern processors anymore :-p\</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the thing about hyperthreading is that each pair of logical cores only actually has one set of hardware for executing the instructions. you don't get nearly double the performance, and it can get very close to being worth nothing depending on the workload.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah, i get something much like that, but CPU benchmarks don't run much faster on "eight" cores than on four. :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; might also be that you're tuning x264 too hard. some of the options are *very* expensive in decoding time for tiny improvements in quality/bitrate :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm usually converting them with vlc and just changing the resolution, nothing really fancy...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hrm, does vlc automatically set the number of threads to use?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; ah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; Blame your carrier. My i9000 has had 2.2 for months</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; not that it was any good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; well, if we get the drivers and stuff for a single model, we could work with that and adapt it to work with all models, couldn't we?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; even with 2.1.1, compared to CM7 it's laggy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Yeah, CM7 got pretty nice with recent updates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; only thing that still bugs me and makes me think of switching back for now, is the huge battery drain</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Wout`: yes, well, samsung hasn't been willing to abandon rfs in their firmwares. ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; Unhelpful: yeah :/ stubborn bunch. Anyway, just want them to release sources to their 2.3 rom so codeworkx and coolya|away can strip out all the stuff we need and optimize CM7 ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Wout`, yeah, I get pretty good average too, the thing that I don't like about it though is that it's unpredictable...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:16]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful wonders where exactly samsung's divx and mkv magic lives... i mean, there are libraries w/ divx and mkv in the name, but the stagefright libraries don't appear to reference those at all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I mean, with 2.2.1 with speedmod, I could go to sleep with 5% battery and still be sure that the alarm clock goes off in the morning, whereas with this I'm afraid even with 25% in the evening (since in one night I had around 20% drop...)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, ever heard of ZN7android16VolumeCustomizerC1Ev ? :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; um, should i have?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; was just curios. I have tried to replace some of the libraries in CM with 2.2.1 ones (to get call recording to work) and have ended up with an error that said some library can't find ZN7android16VolumeCustomizerC1Ev ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and I have no friggin idea what that means. :-p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; OH! that would be a symbol name. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; tried grepping for it in the samsung source code, but couldn't find anything...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it wouldn't be in the source code. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; but where?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; C++, unlike C, allows functions with the same name but different call signatures. how does this *really* work? they actually have different names. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the compiler encodes the call signature in the name, so instead of multiple versions of the same function, you have different functions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; god damn c++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; should've been called c--</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; oh don't blame C++. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; well, if I'd blame myself that would make me look stupid, so I'm not going to do _that_...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; anyway, nm --demangle will decode these :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, ok, thanks :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; so that you see: 00040b11 T android::VolumeCustomizer::VolumeCustomizer(int, bool)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the one you were looking at appears to be: 00040b49 T android::VolumeCustomizer::VolumeCustomizer()</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and is that one in the CM libs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; (I didn't look yet)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; found it by finding the address of the mangled symbol, then finding the same address in the list of demangled symbols.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; huh? i found that in a samsung froyo firmware :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; ohh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Guess I'll have to copy that over to CM if it isn't there. I liked call recording on stock FW...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; *but*! knowing the proper name of the function will make it easier to find - it looks to me like it's namespace android, class VolumeCustomizer, method VolumeCustomizer() - that would be a default constructor method.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; surely implementing call recording on CM couldn't be so hard?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; or you could try one of these? <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=call+recording">http://www.appbrain.com/search?q=call+recording</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, that doesn't work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Well, the apps actually work, but without support from the libraries, they will record the other end from the microphone too, which will result in a very low quality.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; That's why I need to port the libraries of a specific 2.2.1 version over (there was a single version that had software support for 2-way recording, can't recall which one it was though).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Some exotic one from china or whatever, where there are no laws :-p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ick. if android actually used alsa's normal libraries this would be easy :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I don't think codeworkx or coolya will like the idea of having call recording support in the repo though, so I'd have to create a fork or something... :-\</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; *sigh* android - "it's linux, jim, but not as we know it."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; hehe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; at some point I thought about porting some stuff from debian-arm over to it. Like bash and stuff like that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Didn't get too deep into that idea though since I had exams at school.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; the ONLY place i can find to set it, is by using dialer code #*#*4636*#*#, and its coming up as "00"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; if i try to change it, i get "update error"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, I think I have seen someone with the same problem and the solution was to reflash with samsung firmware, change the number and then flash back to CM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; sorry, I don't know more than that because I never use SMS messages (I just call people...) so I don't actually even know if it works for me...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; hmmm, so, to be clear, if i were to flash stock right now, it would come up wrong?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, I'm not sure but that might be the case.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i'll try it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; thx</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; OR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; as an alternative, you could eventually try to flash an alternative modem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; tried that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; (the one for your country/region)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; went from jk4 to jl3</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; are you sure you tried the one that was designed for your region?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; you can't just pick one at random...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; we usually use jk4 with captivate and it works fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; The modem usually contains stuff as the APN settings and SMS center settings, as well as voicemail and stuff like that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, if it works doesn't mean it's the one for your country/region</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; and, the captivate release that codeworkx  posted is jk4 by default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; the regular cap modems wont work, will they?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; ji6, jj4/etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I'm not sure. codeworkx...?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Thing is, you normally need a modem that is ported with the software you are running. Since we don't have any 2.3 modems sources released by samsung I'd guess the devs just used the ones from 2.2.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i believe you are correcyt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; correct</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; anyway, I guess it doesn't hurt to try. You could eventually make a backup just in case.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; there are the ones for the SGS, I'd guess you also have a list like this for the captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; all modems should work</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i'll try the flash stock method and see what happens...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, yes, and it works. But like I said, if you want the one with the proper SETTINGS you should flash the one for your country/region/carrier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, I guess best would be to get a stock FW from samfirmware.com (the one for your region/country/provider obviously), extract the modem.bin from that and flash that over CM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i dont even know what the latest fw IS for the captivate =P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; wasnt there a leak</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i think designgears latest version of cognition is based off a newish leak</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, I'd guess Captivate is from the US, right?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; codeworkx: would a captivate modem.bin work at all? afaik they never *have* due to some audio routing issue related to the voice filter at&amp;t included.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, hmm, samfirmware doesn't have that many details. It just has a list for US and a list for "provider".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, since the Captivate is provider specific I'd guess it should fall under the second category, no Idea though...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, what device do you have?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i can just drop in that modem .bin into one of my existing /radio_captivate.sh outputs, correct?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; techmik67, or you could flash it with heimdall/Odin</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; oh, and ubi/ubifs don't touch flash OOB data, so they'd be flashable to BML, right? those are just a linear mapping of the non-OOB data?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; Unhelpful: never worked with ubi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it's working on my phone very nicely, the next thing i'd like is to try unifying the partitions :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; is it faster in anyway? the yaffs2/ext 4 combo is already flying</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; Wout`: it supports transparent file compression, so there can be less data to read from flash to get the file contents. the main reason, though, would be the ability to wear-level across filesystems, so that the read-mostly /system gets the same wear-levelling as /datadata and /cache, and also that ubi/ubifs is in-kernel and maintained by the mtd developers :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; basically it's *their* successor to jffs2 and an attempt to answer the wide use of yaffs2 in place o jffs2 (which has lots of performance issues, especially on large volumes)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; ah, ok :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; so ubi would also replace ext4?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; no, like yaffs2 and jffs2 it is a bare-flash filesystem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; ok, so it would be a ubi/ext 4 combo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; right</span><br />
