<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but techmik and I are both captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; you're i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; I just released new captivate + vibrant builds of my kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ping codeworkx, i doubt they're not working for him tho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; and vibrant seems to have non-working keys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; oh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; argh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; vibrant ppl saying on thread its fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; sorry - typo: cappy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; has non-working touchkeys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; same for captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or at least, not one jumping up and down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; atinm k, thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and it works for both me and techmik here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; so it either is an issue with my kernel or user part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; man, I can't wait for a captivate source drop . . . kaik needs to be on cm7</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, vaccums in general</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; hope it won't take too long for the cappy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; so we can compare GB source for the SGS + cappy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; fascinate froyo?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; our neighbors dog was way more scared of the vaccum. we were keeping him for a weekend while the owner was out of town and its crate was in the bedroom</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and the cleaning person was dusting and had moved the crate and put the vaccum in the same spot.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; codeworkx afaik the source or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and she dropped something - the dog ran to its crate. except the vaccum was there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; we all fell apart at the poor dog having a heart attack</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; is there a reason to make getDeviceNodes protected?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it was private, yeah.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but now I need it in a different spot as well (and it should have been there already . . .)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; would it be more appropriate to use a friend class instead of changing the protection of the method?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it is bad enough that it is hung up in review, don't make the diffs even worse :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right now they quibble is that this isn't needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because it works on a phone that doesn't share major device number.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i don't actually see anybody saying that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; it was said to codeworkx somewhere</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; that's why I put in the comment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think they're just busy and get a lot of reviews.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but still.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; busy is not the same as there being an actual problem :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I assume Arcee is Ricardo, I think that was who talked to codeworkx.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he's well respected in the CM world, so I figured if he talked to codeworkx, I really should put in the comment.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I assumed it was obvious because the same problem was solved when formatting as well by putting the same block of code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as if they don't, you get a bad partition number and format the wrong device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I just took the same if statement and put it in share/unshare because we need the full major/minor pair as well</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we'll be merged.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, then we will submit a few more ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; like bootable/recovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; *then* the real work . . . SGS specific stuff like device tree, vendor stuff, etc</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I keep an eye on him</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as soon as it seems stable, I'll look at it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the good thing is, this will make all the ROM makers happy and captivate CM7 population will become more eclectic.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;zachy_md|busy&gt; yeah, when that stupid sleep-problem can be solved :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; its interesting that it only happens with our ROM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; because samsungs works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and now it seems it works on captivate too with their kernel</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; didnt realize it was THAT big a drain, since it never shows up as a big draw in battery stats</span><br />
