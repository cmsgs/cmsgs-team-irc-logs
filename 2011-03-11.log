<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so our gpio stuff is now separate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we don't touch nexus s. easier to go upstream</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we have different CONFIG_ stuff because of that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lol - vibrant forum has a a lot of CM7 kernels :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I was one of the first people to respond to that thread</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I was like "you donated, yeah it sucks, but if you wanted to guarantee an end product first, you should have waited until a release, but you didn't, so it' on you"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[4:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; Unhelpful_web: Here in Canada, the daily show and colbert report are aired on broadcast by CTV.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; erm, we have pretty much the same OTA HD super bowl here in USA, or do you mean vs cable?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; you do, absolutely. I record from an American transmitter, after all.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; and even up here, I like to brag about the quality. it's shocking just how much better it really does look</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; we don't do OTA stuff really anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; though I did consider buying an HD antenna once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; it's quite popular, but several people in our househald default to TV whenever we live w/ cable, and if we *were* to use more discretion in watching, then what exactly would we be *paying for*?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: no such thing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; I find it very enjoyable when I show someone a recording, and they are agape at the quality of the picture. and then I inform them I pay exactly zero dollars.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful_web, hmm?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: as an "HD" antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well that's how I've always heard them refferred to as</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; although if your current antenna is very very old, it might just be better.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; heh, very true. HD antenna == regular antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: "them"? "they" are the same antennas people used to use for UHF/VHF.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; unless they're suckers and bought an HD antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; most HD stations are UHF</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes, I'm sure electronically they're the same, I don't claim to understand how this stuff works :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; which is why I only ever considered it, but I remember reading a bit about it before the digital conversion thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; Kaik541: basically, OTA HD is just UHF with a different carrier protocol. the signal is the same, but the protocol carries HD content</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: an antenna is a carefully-designed metal stick that resonates w/ broadcast radio waves. you only need a different one if the intended broadcast frequencies change, and they haven't.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful_web, here's the article I think i first read that got me along the lines of this thought process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; <a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5138746/build-your-own-dtv-antenna">http://lifehacker.com/#!5138746/build-your-own-dtv-antenna</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; basically we're using the same range of frequencies to broadcast digital HD w/ a different modulation scheme - but none of those other details are relevant to antenna design, an antenna is effectively an inert object.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I have no idea about the practicality or usefulness of it, wihch is why I only considered it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: do you have *an* antenna now? and is your TV recent? then you can already connect your antenna and watch OTA HD.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I do not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; I used to pick up channels on a length of coax I had</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; we have direct antenna connection to one TV and also to a HD HomeRun box :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; mersault: cheap coax, then. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; it previously ran from the TV to the cable box. Unplugged the cable end. boom, antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; i mean, isn't the whole point of coax for it *not* to act like an antenna?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; Unhelpful_web: oh, for sure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; not really. coax is a pretty old standard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; you can get shielded versions now, I presume, but its expensive.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; um... wasn't the sheath always *supposed* to reduce leakage in/out of the cable?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; it's mostly just a measurement of the guage of copper wire</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; coax doesn't require a metal sheath, I don't think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; remember, coax is from the 70s or earlier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; there was a lot less shit in the spectrum then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; even on very modern setups, if you're watching non-digital channels I see overlap from broadcast TV of the cable channels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful_web is pretty sure it was always metal-sheathed, after all the name is descriptive. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i remember my 1st cable box...... 1976</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; here in Toronto it's possible to figure out what show is on CBC by watching Rogers' tv guide channel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; same frequency, so the TV sees both.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; the conductive sheath is part of the standard, and is "coaxial" with the core conductor. both are connected electrically at each end.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; well, I was making presumptions, admittedly. But a 50 or 100 foot length of coax will generally pick up extra signal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; no matter the quality</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; this is one of the reasons we moved to cat 5 in IT</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; mm, twisted-pair is another (and probably *better*) interference-prevention scheme</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; vastly superior</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; also, I am pretty close to one of the most concentrated sources of EM radiation on earth, most likely.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; The CN tower is pretty ridiculous for transmitters</span><br />
