<span class="irc-date">[0:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he logs on here - I asked him not to and I really don't see the point. I mean at least the other guy is adding voodoo sound, OC etc - things that do require a different kernel. But this is just bull.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; could you work through sourceforge to have it removed? it's not a fork, it's not anything...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; well, lets talk to him first.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; maybe coolya, codeworkx and I weren't explicit enough.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and it is open source, he *can* do what he's doing. It is just stupid.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I did add a note in red.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; or make them smaller.</span><br />
