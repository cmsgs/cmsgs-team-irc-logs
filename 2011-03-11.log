<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so our gpio stuff is now separate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we don't touch nexus s. easier to go upstream</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and we have different CONFIG_ stuff because of that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; lol - vibrant forum has a a lot of CM7 kernels :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I was one of the first people to respond to that thread</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I was like "you donated, yeah it sucks, but if you wanted to guarantee an end product first, you should have waited until a release, but you didn't, so it' on you"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[4:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; Unhelpful_web: Here in Canada, the daily show and colbert report are aired on broadcast by CTV.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; erm, we have pretty much the same OTA HD super bowl here in USA, or do you mean vs cable?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; you do, absolutely. I record from an American transmitter, after all.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; and even up here, I like to brag about the quality. it's shocking just how much better it really does look</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; we don't do OTA stuff really anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; though I did consider buying an HD antenna once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; it's quite popular, but several people in our househald default to TV whenever we live w/ cable, and if we *were* to use more discretion in watching, then what exactly would we be *paying for*?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: no such thing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; I find it very enjoyable when I show someone a recording, and they are agape at the quality of the picture. and then I inform them I pay exactly zero dollars.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful_web, hmm?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: as an "HD" antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well that's how I've always heard them refferred to as</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; although if your current antenna is very very old, it might just be better.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; heh, very true. HD antenna == regular antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: "them"? "they" are the same antennas people used to use for UHF/VHF.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; unless they're suckers and bought an HD antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; most HD stations are UHF</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes, I'm sure electronically they're the same, I don't claim to understand how this stuff works :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; which is why I only ever considered it, but I remember reading a bit about it before the digital conversion thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; Kaik541: basically, OTA HD is just UHF with a different carrier protocol. the signal is the same, but the protocol carries HD content</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: an antenna is a carefully-designed metal stick that resonates w/ broadcast radio waves. you only need a different one if the intended broadcast frequencies change, and they haven't.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful_web, here's the article I think i first read that got me along the lines of this thought process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; <a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5138746/build-your-own-dtv-antenna">http://lifehacker.com/#!5138746/build-your-own-dtv-antenna</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; basically we're using the same range of frequencies to broadcast digital HD w/ a different modulation scheme - but none of those other details are relevant to antenna design, an antenna is effectively an inert object.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I have no idea about the practicality or usefulness of it, wihch is why I only considered it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: do you have *an* antenna now? and is your TV recent? then you can already connect your antenna and watch OTA HD.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I do not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; I used to pick up channels on a length of coax I had</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; we have direct antenna connection to one TV and also to a HD HomeRun box :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; mersault: cheap coax, then. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; it previously ran from the TV to the cable box. Unplugged the cable end. boom, antenna.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; i mean, isn't the whole point of coax for it *not* to act like an antenna?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; Unhelpful_web: oh, for sure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; not really. coax is a pretty old standard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; you can get shielded versions now, I presume, but its expensive.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; um... wasn't the sheath always *supposed* to reduce leakage in/out of the cable?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; it's mostly just a measurement of the guage of copper wire</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; coax doesn't require a metal sheath, I don't think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; remember, coax is from the 70s or earlier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; there was a lot less shit in the spectrum then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; even on very modern setups, if you're watching non-digital channels I see overlap from broadcast TV of the cable channels</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful_web is pretty sure it was always metal-sheathed, after all the name is descriptive. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i remember my 1st cable box...... 1976</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; here in Toronto it's possible to figure out what show is on CBC by watching Rogers' tv guide channel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; same frequency, so the TV sees both.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; the conductive sheath is part of the standard, and is "coaxial" with the core conductor. both are connected electrically at each end.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; well, I was making presumptions, admittedly. But a 50 or 100 foot length of coax will generally pick up extra signal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; no matter the quality</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; this is one of the reasons we moved to cat 5 in IT</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; mm, twisted-pair is another (and probably *better*) interference-prevention scheme</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; vastly superior</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; also, I am pretty close to one of the most concentrated sources of EM radiation on earth, most likely.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[5:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; The CN tower is pretty ridiculous for transmitters</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[5:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; Just an FYI before you start jumping on my throat again. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; Kaik541: I did talk with coolya|away and he didn't have a problem with it...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I remember him saying he was ok with you making nightlies but I don't remember anything about sharing them, if he says you're cool with it than I'm ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I think that's how atinm, I and techmik took it which is the only reason we PM'd you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; or at least I pm'd you, not sure about the others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; he said codeworkx and atinm|night were upset about them, but he didn't care</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[6:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; it was more of a science experiment for me than anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I wasn't upset, I was just under the impression that the people dev'ing were against it, if the vibrant dev (coolya) isn't, that's his perogative</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I know atinm is strongly against it for captivate</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[6:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; and i wasn't going to post his until he gave me the ok</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[6:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yeah I noticed it was only vibrant, and like I said, if I misunderstood and coolya doesn't mind for vibrant feel free to put them back or whatever</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; I just finished writing the script to fully automate the vibrant make and upload.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; because that's just a misunderstanding on my part (my PM wasn't meant to sound like jumping down your throat either, was just confusion)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; I will eventually add the others to it, but won't make that script live until then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; no, atinm|night was though in the xda thread on the post that  I forgot about :(</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[6:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; don't worry about it, I don't think anyone is particularly mad, just some users on the captivate forum have somehow found your project page labeled "cmsgsnightlies"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and keep asking about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; yea, that is what I asked coolya|away if it was cool, he was fine with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; I will change it so it says unofficial cm7 nightiles</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; or not affiliated or someting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; that would probably be a good idea, though we've just told captivate users to not do anything that doesn't say "teamhacksung" for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; like I said, i'm not even building anything other than vibrant right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but like I said, I wasn't meaning to sound like I was jumping down your throat, just confusion because I was under the impression it wasn't wanted... but if coolya is ok with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; which you said he was</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; then there's no problem/issue</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[6:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; hrm, is there a geomagneticd in the i9k gingerbread leak? i'm assuming yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; Unhelpful_web: yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; and orientationd, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; coolya: what do the magnetic sensor readings w/ our code look like if we run the geomagneticd? i am more and more suspecting that it's the magic we're missing, but i don't think i can write our own code to do this. :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; specifically, if you watch the magnetometer in a sensor app, do its outputs behave sanely under rotation? because they don't now, and i suspect that we need some code to set the rough/fine offset settings on the sensor to fix this.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; dasunsrule32, well, you could set the cron to execute every minute for testing purposes...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; or every 10 minutes or whatever</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; I didn't try it sofar. GuiPert wanted to give it a try and played around with that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; yea, i thought about that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dasunsrule32&gt; thx</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; right now things are *not* sane - for example, a 180 degree rotation around an axis should invert the values of the other two axes. this does not happen.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; a 90 degree rotation around an axis should swap the values of the other two axes, inverting one of them. this also does not happen at present.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; these are very basic sanity tests for a sensor that is *supposed* to be measuring some fixed external field as a vector while you rotate the sensor in it. the accelerometer pretty much passes the test. the magnetometer fails miserably.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; we *may* just need the geomagneticd running. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; in which case maybe it can just be an opaque vendor binary and i don't need to worry about reverse-engineering all of its mysteriousness. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; Unhelpful_web: GuiPert told me he was getting some errors about unknown events when he started it, but i think that is fixable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; i would really like to see things go that way so that i can get back to the math i *started on*, because i think i can still do something *good* there if i can get nice readings. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; ie, i think i can make the orientation reading more stable, and especially nice would be that with a quaternion-based orientation we can do interpolation between values on it - this is good because we could add smoothing to the orientation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; we could also try asking yamaha nicely for *real* documents... ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; maybe we should. I can ask someone korea, too. If they would give us some docs. Maybe one has success</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; really *really* nice would be open-source code for the device for linux, possibly based on the yas529 driver already in the wild. i've seen threads various places about trying to get readings out of the thing w/ usb-attached i2c adaptors, so i don't think it's *entirely* crazy to assume that good linux support for their device might have value beyond android where they can just provide a proprietary daemon to OEMs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; Unhelpful_web: I mailed with one of them who got it working. He would anser quiestions but can't give us any docs. But without docs i think it will be hard.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; it really will. again, *if* it works, the geomagneticd as a vendor binary might be our fastest route, here. it would hardly be the only vendor binary on our phone, or any other that CM builds for.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; i've been trying to use geomagneticd *as* a doc for calibrating the sensor but i only got as far as mapping events from geomagnetic_raw to tasks to do. as far as the actual meat of *performing* those tasks it's all math i don't understand.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; evaluate: yes, the public datasheet doesn't  even have most of what we *do* know - how to read/right the offset values, the sensor values, and the calibration matrix.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I see a lot of references to yas529 from meego posts, but nothing points me toward where they're starting from</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Kaik541, yup, noticed that already</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, if you want I could try and see if I can get hold of the meego source code, they seem to have a driver for this chip...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; yes but they don't use it as  a real compass and that is only the kernel part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; we have a kernel driver too, and it's very similar to theirs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; the issue is that the kernel driver exposes two devices - one used to report data on the measured magnetic field, and one used to interact with some sort of internal calibration system in the sensor.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; this appears to be what the proprietary geomagneticd does - it doesn't even touch the regular geomagnetic device, just geomagnetic_raw, and it has complicated math that it does on the values reported there, and it writes to sysfs files associated with it that (in the driver) trigger i2c writes to the device.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Unhelpful, you said that the reading you get don't seem to be right though, didn't you?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; yes, but i'm not doing any of this complicated calibration to geomagnetic_raw at present.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; the descriptions attached to these values suggest that they're important to calibration. that they're sent to the device suggests that *it* performs corrections on data with them, rather than leaving that to the software. my suspicion is that just running geomagneticd may show some improvement for us. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; is this what we also already have: <a href="http://lxr.post-tech.com/source/drivers/input/misc/yamaha_v1/yas529.c?v=linux-2.6.32">http://lxr.post-tech.com/source/drivers/input/misc/yamaha_v1/yas529.c?v=linux-2.6.32</a> ?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; btw, we should get rid of all of the axis swapping and inverting stuff for the magnetometer in libsensors. it turns out you can incorporate inversion of the z axis and rotation by 90, 180, or 270 degrees around the z axis into the correction matrix the driver applies by writing to the "position" file for the sensor in sysfs. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[7:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; so what libsensors probably *should* do is read a property giving the appropriate sensor position, and write it to sysfs.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I have just built meself a new update with the disabled JNI checks :-p</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; there seems to be a drop in FPS when you first switch the handset on, for about 3 minutes or so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; is that what causes the lag?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; not sure what JNI checks are?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I don't know, but I saw codeworkx commit that right now and the description says "The extended JNI checks will cause the system to run more slowly, but they can spot a variety of nasty bugs" so I thought, hell let's give this a shot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I also didn't flash anything for a couple of days now, so my fingers were itching too... :-p</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and this was a pretty good reason to recompile...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; I started to sync the repo as part of initial install, but it was grinding my connection to a halt</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; I'm back to waiting on the forums to update</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Let's see... :-D</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[11:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; is the build running nicely?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; coolya, you gave the ok for posting vibrant nightlies?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; What build?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[11:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; curious - because I definitely did not want that until we had some stability.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; the build that you just flashed evaluate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; mikebeecham, tbh I don't feel much difference from the previous one...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; heh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; nothing new or fixed?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; but then again, CM is running smooth anyway...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; Well, there have been a couple of commits...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and dasunsrule32 thinks you gave him the ok, so he went ahead. I guess I didn't particularly care until I saw the posts on the captivate forum. vibrant folks are crazy, but captivate are a little more dumb and as crazy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; perhaps I need to stump my desire to flash everything :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mikebeecham&gt; and wait a few days ata a time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; my last update was in 09.03, so I definitely needed a fresher one :-D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; they'll start flashing vibrant nightlies ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|night&gt; and I figure we'll start doing nightlies once we set it up - would prefer them to be somewhat official.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;codeworkx&gt; atinm we decided to not have nightlies. if we're on mailine we'll get auto nightlies</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; so that's your first problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; embizzle: what do yoe with wifi is on ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; and second, I'm not sure 3g data works when wifi is on even with the stock rom, that also doesn't make any sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; why would you want to download over 3g when you are connected to wifi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I don't have 3g</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; but regardless, I can't use the phone when my wifi is on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; that's the problem. not that I can't use 3g or even 2g</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; when my wifi is turned on, I can not dial out or receive calls. my dialer automatically requires me to enter a SIP account or wont dial out. Anyone trying to call me just gets voicemail</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I should be able to use the phone with wifi on lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; you did a wipe? looks like some strange thing xD</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; I am postiive that on a stock rom I would be able to make and receive phone calls while my wifi is on :\ I'm not talking about 3g evaluate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; when I am using my phone, I can't access data (that's a separate issues from whether wifi is turned on)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; coolya you recommend a full wipe?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; to see if that's the issue</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chek0v&gt; embizzle: all this shit about flashing stock/etc is whatever. if you delete all the data on the phone you dont need to flash an old rom just to delete it, and flash something else on top</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; 2G and 2.5G don't support data exchange while a call is running.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;embizzle&gt; it's more than just forcing me to use sip</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; easier merge upstream</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; maybe we just need to check the default light - display brightness settings</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; maybe the defaults are not good for our sensor driver</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; on the other hand, xcaliburinhand is using our kernel as base now with my changes, and he'll get it because he's done this twice already with i9000 eclair and froyo code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when he did reorient+headset for captivate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so he might actually get it faster than I do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'll ping him</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I'm more interested right now in what we need to do to get into mainline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think renaming android_device_samsung_common to aries is needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as a start</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so we're really separate from crespo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; atinm: then ou have to remove the aries subfolder in that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; otherwise its a bit doubled aries/arries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yeah . . . but we can come up with a name. we'll have trouble if we move crespo shit around</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since everyone is using that as the base, and we know that that is the upstream at google</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; yes but there is no crespo stuff in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I mean that common implies common to all samsung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; what about devices/samsung/aries-common like the did with passion from htc ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; much better</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; :-D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes, so lets do that. should make it look cleaner. as far as our building of initramfs etc - that is all within our tree, correct?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; hmmm... last time I tried that my keyboard got screwed up... but wait... swype ties itself to the phone type at installation, which I discovered when you guys changed the build between 0303 and 0310</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ohayden&gt; I initially tried on lenny but ran into a compiler issue</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ohayden&gt; I could have updated gcc, but meh</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;evaluate&gt; I was just wondering, how does the Settings app know which is the external and which is the internal SD card? Does it just take the first one as the internal and the other one as external? Caus right now it seems to get them wrong...</span><br />
