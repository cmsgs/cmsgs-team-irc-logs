<span class="irc-date">[3:22]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful has been thinking of looking for mergeable bits to push for upstream - [SPACE] support seems an easy choice, the various device/samsung/* things as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; the reboot download support in recovery is probably not a problem as long as we make it target-specific</span><br />
