<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; i'm incined toward cfq, it has special support for non-rotational media, and we *do* still need a schedular to deal with contention for read/write bandwidth between processes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; Unhelpful_web, heh, I'm just curious since this is the first time I've messed around with any of this undervolting stuff and xan's app lets me choose (and I didn't honestly know the difference)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; noop is a strict fifo queue for read/write requests. if some background app does a gigantic bulk I/O, and you cause a foreground app to initiate I/O before it completes, you're going to notice.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; then I shall stick with CFQ</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; certain people seem convinced that CFQ will cause the CPU to spend *very large amounts* of time on computations regarding queue ordering.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; BFS! BFS! BFS!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; mersault: that's a different problem domain, we are talking about I/O schedulers...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; ah, why so you are. I was just skimming and saw CFQ</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; which I read as CFS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; ah.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; yes, BFS has some things in its favor for us, though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; and was reading about that stuff recently</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; for small numbers of CPUs and processes it's faster than CFS, or so i understand.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; anyway, apparently I either need to pay attention to the chat, or not participate at all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault&gt; otherwise I put my foot in my mouth</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; a lot is made of CFS being O(1), but big-O notation causes people to forget that there is a per-algorithm constant multiplier outside to the big-O expression, and for some algorithms it can be quite large.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault|away&gt; lots of people don't really understand big-O</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; it's not hard to understand. at all. though i'll admit that i'm *not* in the class of people who produce proofs of algorithms' big-O efficiency claims. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault|away&gt; just people something is easy to understand doesn't mean most people will</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mersault|away&gt; lots of people read a single article on it, and assume they know everything about it and all it's implications</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; if people would write it as c*O() maybe the constant-multiplier business wouldn't be forgotten. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; there are *lots* of algorithms with good big-O execution times that are appallingly slow and never used except for very very large problem sets</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; because if you're comparing times of 10^9s * O(1) with 5 * O(n) you're going to need a pretty big n before the first algorithm is better.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; big O logic was my least favorite class</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it was taught to me by the guy who invented plasma screen technology</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and that's about all I took away from that class</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; LOTS.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so like memento?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but with robots?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;designfears&gt; don't momento run backasswards</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: um, no, not really like memento. *certain* anime writers seem to be obsessed with the question of what role our past plays in who we are, and whether we would be "ourselves" in any meaningful way if we did not remember our past.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; memento really has relatively little of that iirc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; that's true, I suppose memento is more of he remembers who he was but not who he is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; the setting for Big O involves an entire city of people who have no memories beyond a certain point in their past</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; they should move to a new city</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; might as well start fresh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; hush you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; that's not really the point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; did the main character used to be evil?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; because that's the onlylogical reason to have a gigantic robot</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; uberushaximus: i enjoyed both, actually. i think they both deal with fairly serious themes, but one one of them, um, takes itself, a bit less seriously than the other. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so you're saying he built his giant destructive robot in ANTICIPATION of other people with giant evil things?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: why does he have to have built his first?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; but in any case he *finds* it, and somehow seems to be able to operate it, although he has no memory of why he would know how. :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I'd think the evil person would have prevented him from building one if the good guy didn't already have one first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:17]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* Unhelpful_web didn't know evil meant omniscient as well. in fact, fictional bad guys are very very far from omniscient, usually they're quite ignorant and stupid. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; ie, death star destroyed by one well-placed torpedo shot. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well since everything seems to be relative to THAT city</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and he had a giant smasher thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I'd smash everything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; it's like how batman is only in gotham city and that's where everything bad happens :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; well its a good thing for Gotham that he IS there...or is it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; though, supposedly, the world of superman and batman exist in the same place</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so metropolis and gotham city both exist in the same universe, meaning only big cities are unfortunate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I try not to think about the DC Universe and based on some of the arcs that have happened I dont think DC thinks about it too much themselves</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; Kaik541: the bulk of the population is in large cities, so 1) supervillains are simply more likely to happen to be in one 2) VIIIIIIICTIIIIIIIIIIIMS for villain who tend toward the sort of thing where that matters. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; what about the whole show "Smallville"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; wihch starts almost exclusively in a small town</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; what would the joker do in the country, terrorize cows?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; I'd pay to see that movie</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; also, what about the "arkham asylum" game which took place on a mythical world equivalent of alcratraz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; arkham exists in gotham</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; well it's a little bit away</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; but it may as well be in gotham since it's across the bay</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; that's like saying alcatraz is in san francisco though</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; just saying. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; uberushaximus, yes, but clearly separate... the game was terrorizing everything there even though it was a very small community</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; you actually pass a sign in the opening credits that clearly shows that it's another city</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; uberushaximus: oh, also, escaflowne. since you mention comparing mech-anime, i have always had a soft spot for escaflowne because it was the only series where i felt the movements of mecha were ponderous enough to be plausible.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I must have missed that part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; I still haven't seen that one Unhelpful_web, I'll have to get around to it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; they move like they actually weigh as much as something that large would have to weigh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; uberushaximus: avoid the movie. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; that gets me is that Mecha are no longer cool enough by themselves, I loved the look of Gasaraki but not the alien story....or, lets say, the end of Evangeleon</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I can't ever seem to get it to work in dosbox :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;TMC_Sherpa&gt; but but but, before 3050 it was all lost tech, no one knew how to make any of that stuff anymore, you just used whatever still worked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; Kaik541: did you try Freedos + Virtualbox?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; armored core was the closest I've been able to find, but that game is clunky</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; uberushaximus, no I have not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I always forget about freedos...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; oh, Big O is mentioned under Crowing Music of Awesome, too :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; but Macross is pretty much *made of* that trope. every single series ends with somebody singing a song that *literally* saves the world.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; what came 1st, those sseries you are talking about or the robotech books?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; techmik67: macross, then robotech, which was assembled from the first macross series and two not-really-related ones, with a *very* edited script, and then the books.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i read the robotech 1-12 books when they came out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; grerat concepts, i thought</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; great*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; they really have very very little to do with the original series. protoculture is not a technology, it is a civilization. :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; i would say that is certainly different!!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; indeed. it also makes it make a *lot* more sense when aliens are confused by humans in the series - they think that humans may be remnants of the protoculture.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; yeah, that does change things alot</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; it also, to a certain extent, means culture itself - the zentradi don't really *have* a culture to speak of in the first macross series, and humans are their first close encounter with such things.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[3:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;techmik67&gt; so its not a break from their "warrior" culture and exposure to emotions etween humans that is the issue, it's a whole new concept...... why change that, io wonder?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; techmik67: well, ok, i guess technically they have something like a culture... if you call a chain-of-command a culture by itself. :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[3:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful_web&gt; but yes, the idea of interacting in any way other than giving and following orders is fairly foreign to them.</span><br />
