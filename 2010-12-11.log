<span class="irc-date">[1:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;skeeterslint&gt; i think you can run make distclean or something if you make code changes</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; make clean should probably suffice, most of the time. and you shouldn't even need to do that unless you edit things in makefiles - output is *supposed* to depend on source files and be rebuilt automatically.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; didn't work for me with last few changes, ran make 3 times, one with each change, and none of them were present in the build, I had to make clean</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i'm not sure what the status of camera is. iirc on captivate preview is greyscale, video mode force-closes</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[2:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nice. maybe you need to compare the extracted proprietary files, see if there's anything we're copying that you're not?</span><br />
