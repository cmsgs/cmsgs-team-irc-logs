<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;rwicl|work&gt; gsm shouldve been able to see networks, though i think the cdma support broke that</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; at present i can see networks, use data, and i have voice mail notification. i haven't synced for a few days but that much is working.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; yeah. there were a few things i added to cmsgs last night to settle some issues... basically just that it needs to know the names of interfaces to use for data access, and for tethering.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[1:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; yep it is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ah, ok. is this going somewhere? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; most likely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; got data running on epic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; is platform_hardware_alsa_sound on cmsgs working in i9000 or vibrant? audioflinger dies on epic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i don't have i9k or vibrant... but i know that notification audio etc is working on captivate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;skeeterslint&gt; i think you can run make distclean or something if you make code changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;skeeterslint&gt; misstell</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; make clean should probably suffice, most of the time. and you shouldn't even need to do that unless you edit things in makefiles - output is *supposed* to depend on source files and be rebuilt automatically.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; didn't work for me with last few changes, ran make 3 times, one with each change, and none of them were present in the build, I had to make clean</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; is the camera different as well? doesn't work either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ugh, lame. :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; i'm not sure what the status of camera is. iirc on captivate preview is greyscale, video mode force-closes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; on epic fc on start</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; nice. maybe you need to compare the extracted proprietary files, see if there's anything we're copying that you're not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;forcystos&gt; yea that's what I thought. for now I'm just using the device tree noobnl and skeeter built</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; hrm, objdump says i have all the libs glgps_samsungJupiter needs. wonder why it won't run? :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; it exits w/ "file not found", which generally means the linker or a library is missing. will have to strace it, i guess.</span><br />
