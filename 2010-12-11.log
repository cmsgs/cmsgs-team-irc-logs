<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;rwicl|work&gt; gsm shouldve been able to see networks, though i think the cdma support broke that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;rwicl|work&gt; last i remember</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; at present i can see networks, use data, and i have voice mail notification. i haven't synced for a few days but that much is working.</span><br />
