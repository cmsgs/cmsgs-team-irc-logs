<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; my latest commit doesn't look terrible if you diff it against the original cyanogenmod makefile</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and it'll get it approved I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since we touch *nothing*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; just crap on our own part of the makefile ... theirs looks like it always has..</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; given that we can't discuss this with him . . . I say we make sure it works and doesn't break anything else and try submitting again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I was afraid he wasn't going to like us touching anything else . . . we're in our own world..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: i have a minimal to remove the duplication already. i think i'll put it up as another task.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; how about we try to submit two separate ones. one that is exactly what he asked, and another that cleans up everything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; is that what you meant?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok, tournament in 30 minutes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: this is cleanup *without* adding our options. just tested, works for one and encore. :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and he's just going to get mad . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can we do it in two stages? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; ...that's what i was *trying* to do, the cleanup will make our changes *smaller* :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; yes, I meant to first resubmit the patch with dup so we meet us (not concerned about duplication).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and get merged in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; then send another that cleans it up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; he'll be more willing to listen then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; right now he'll just think we're talking back . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; if you think so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; if he took the time, it might work</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; for 2.2.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; an animated boot animation o.O</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; bootscreen*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; as in froyo . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I guess it would be a start. would much prefer if he tried it on android_kernel_samsung . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; teamhacksung kernel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yes, but he ported it from cappy to i9000 kernel, so he at least has an idea of what the process is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; can't hurt to try and bring him into the fold as it were</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; froyo to froyo isn't hard actually.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; since now we have the code for both</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; cappy and i9000 - I was looking today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; while trying to pull the froyo stuff into our kernel for A1026</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the issue before was trying to port eclair cappy code to froyo i9000 code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and now its a similar sort of issue porting froyo code to gingerbread - only more so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; driver has changed some.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; has got cleaner - and the A1026 was really hacked in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I'm sure he'd be willing to try and join int he fold</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; just like xcalibur has</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so I'm again wanting to just wait until samsung puts out GB for cappy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but would be happy for the help</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I can send him a PM asking about his interest in CM7/GB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; since I know he had some interest in 6.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; sure, yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; would be nice to have another captivate dev</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; (we will take over the US market anyway ;) )</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; while googling A1026, found some articles which said it is Nexus One that had the chip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and was the reason for the pristine sound quality.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; did Nexus One get GB?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and I was mistaken about A1026 being on the Nexus S - or at least, i cannot find a reference that confirms/denies that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; yeah nexus one got gb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; !</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and it does have the chip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; need a source ptr.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; maybe they have a real driver for the A1026 chip</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; tho gpios etc wil lbe different, still.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[0:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; atinm: i'm going to stash this for now, it won't apply if a patch that adds another duplication goes in, but it won't be hard to do-over either: <a href="http://pastie.org/1720213">http://pastie.org/1720213</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; hmm, JVK seems pretty smooth so far</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; even for a sammy room</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; rom</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; curio seemed to agree</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[9:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; wait a week or two</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; and it will slow down like all sammy roms</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; 2.2.1 is pretty smooth after a fresh install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; are you crazy? I never stay on the same rom for two weeks :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; but as more services and apps are running in the background it slows down due RFS issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; :-D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; anyway, if there is anything you guys want that could be useful (grabbing files, dmesg, logcats, etc..) let me know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; give me a source tar.gz :-P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; I've got a script checking the samsung opensource site every 30 mins for updates :P so when it drops, i'll let you know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;coolya&gt; i would love if just the opensource center from samsung would be able to send me an email if a model i subscribed too got an update</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Wout`&gt; suggest it to your contact ;)</span><br />
