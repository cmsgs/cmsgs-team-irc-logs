<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; how am I supposed to...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; nevermind.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; also it's templated, so if we want to do fixed-point math in biasmodel at some point (might save a *lot* of time w/ the matrix manipulation stuff), we can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; to debug for a device you don't have? i don't think you *are* supposed to?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; magics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; though I'm curious why they're getting a kernel panic at all considering you can't use a custom kernel on the atrix xD</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; he did say something along the lines of if they can figure that out, they'll unlock the bootloader</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; I don't get why more people don't look at what the xperia x10 guys did and just use kexec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; since that seems like a perfectly suited way to get around a bad bootloader</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; going to ignore it . . .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; why do DG's ppl think I work with him...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; (I assume this is another)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:19]</span> <span class="irc-green">* acdbx (~acdbx@cpe-66-75-28-44.san.res.rr.com) has joined this channel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nah, DG left the atrix because of the "locked bootloader shit" even though it has literally not affected his ability at all since he doesn't know how to make a custom kernel anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; if that's the reason he wants to pretend he couldn't do anything more than deodex and add a reboot option to the atrix, so be it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; I was hoping he'd go to the atrix.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; then I'd never run into him again because without being able to load a kernel, it might as well not exist for me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; curio is working on it too and invited me to join.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; guess he has an atrix</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm|away&gt; or time on his hands.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;chaembian_&gt; Good morning, guys!</span><br />
