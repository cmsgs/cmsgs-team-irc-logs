<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Unhelpful&gt; bah. the values i got earlier from poking @ the offsets file for the magnetometer don't make any sense. unless i messed up in collecting them. probably did.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; ok so that's interesting, I'm usually incapable of using i9000 modems without losing service, but now I seem to have a different bug where the data is the only thing that breaks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; instead of losing all service/reception, my data goes down, and then restarts, but I stay connected to the network</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and I can even place calls just fine when it happens... that's a step in the right direction</span><br />
