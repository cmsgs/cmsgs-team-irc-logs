<span class="irc-date">[12:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; ahh ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; captivate is the only one he could debug since that's the only one he has</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; which is why he wants all the GPIO's listed one by one and what they do, which I believe chaembian_ said he's gonna try and do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; i am kind of surprised more people arent reporting it ... tells you how many people actually receive calls :))</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; or how many people use headsets for calls (I never do)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; Kaik541, i DONT use headset</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; this issue is just with the phone's speaker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; or mic rather</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh, I must've misread</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; well it could be related to the headset changes - because thats the major change between 26th and 31st release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well GPIO's were messed with around microphone stuff, but kang's kernel should have it as well since he rebases</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; thats the strange part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; with 26th CM release and Kang's kernel - it works fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; kang, 's 1st April kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; when you have issues with this, do you ever make a call first and THEN get a call? or is the receiving of the call ALWAYS the first call? or never?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; well... its an issue i had quite often. but in the logcat i posted - i had flashed and asked my wife to call me immediately</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; so no received call preceded it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; hmm, can you attempt to replicate it under both conditions?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; yeah - can do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; reboot, receive and test AND reboot, call out, and then receive and see if it happens under both conditions?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; will flash back to 31st</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; maybe something isn't getting started until after the first call is placed, though if it happens under both conditions then that rules that out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; my wild guess was that it was getting initialized assuming headset was plugged in</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; but here goes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; scenario 1 - i receive a call first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; voice appears to sound mettalic and caller cant hear me clearly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-green">* stickpin (~stickpin@84.94.109.203.cable.012.net.il) has joined this channel.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; scneario 2 - i call and then receive - it seems fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; but after scenario 2, caller calls back - metallic again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so from the sound of things, something is getting turned on when you first place a call out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and is turned off after you hang up from a recieved call</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but not getting turned back on with a recieved call</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; lol @ "from the sound of things"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; ah, puns :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; anyway the other thing is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; after a few seconds (15 sec thereabouts) - caller hears me better</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so it sounds like it is getting turned on... but takes time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; now, I know absolutely nothing about how this works, so I'm just going to ask anyone who might know more than me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; and is it safe to infer - its NOT in the kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; when GPIO's are "turned on", is there a way to tune the voltage and could that possibly have an effect?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; because 26h release with kang 's kernel from 1st Apr works fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; the other option is that it's just an issues with the 03/31 build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but from ROM, not from kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; i hazard to guess that its ROM related</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; if it's not too much to ask, try the 03/31 build with kang's newest kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and see if the issue persists</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; and then same kernel on old build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; i ahve done that before - it persists</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; then I'm gonna say it's build date related</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; which means upstream, which means it's hopefully fixed by now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; or that it was just built mid multiple patches or somthin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; as noone with a captivate has reported this, and our build was built two days later</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; while i9000 and vibrant had 3/18, 3/26, and 3/31</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; so the choice is, it was introduced after the 20th, and fixed by the 2nd, or it really just doesn't affect captivates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:07]</span> <span class="irc-green">* noone_linux is now known as mxracer_linux</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; or captivate users are lazy and don't submit useful bug reports (sadly, this is very likely)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; since the thread is full of "is this [well known bug] known? I didn't see it on the issue tracker" and then i respond with a clearly visible link to the issue tracker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; the thing is issue reported on vibrant on 28th march =&gt; issuew ith 26th build - which I have no problem with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; on the i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; then my guess is demon magic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; unless the person who reported on the vibrant made their own build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; this is why we need to hurry up and get mainline'd :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; mhmm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; I have a build for captivate that I just made last night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; but it has voodoo things compiled in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; is it kang's kernel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nope, it's your own based on your repo :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; mhmm :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; well as long as the kernel is kept up to date with teamhacksung's and just has voodoo improvements, it *should* still work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; does someone need it? because I can upload it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; nah, he's got an i9000/vibrant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; I'm on school nets anyway so I can get ~1MB up, I might as well, lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; it's already halfway up, damn</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; thanks uberushaximus - on i9000</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; 26th ROM with kang 's kernel works fine for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when kang comes, ask whether he is has merged in the latest kernel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; from teamhacksung</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; he rebases all the time when he builds I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I think the speaker/headset etc should be the same.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I haven't done anything since our first "success"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; but based on the fact that it works fine with a newer kernel on an older ROM, I tihnk it's ROM-related</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; and given that even if i use kang 's new kernel on the new ROM, the issue persists.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; the logcat is just saying it is going to earpiece.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can you also post a dmesg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can't really work on this now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; switched back to 26th March ROM now ... will switch and post later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; but post both a dmesg and logcat from the same time (right after when the other side can't hear)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; when do i run dmesg?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; nothing should have changed in the rom related to this tho.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; after hanging up? during call?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; knowsnotmuch, "adb shell dmesg"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; soon after the other side can't hear</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; during is fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Kaik541&gt; oh when, geeze, I should learn to read</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; after is fine too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; just soon after.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;uberushaximus&gt; you could just tail dmesg and watch what it does the whole way though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;knowsnotmuch&gt; i can do a adb shell dmesg &gt; dmesg for the call duration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I hate reading smali</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; when I have to try to decipher samsung hacks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; reading their external sd mount stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; and realized that they have an external and internal storage, and they just do both.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; I have to try to do it in a clean way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; can't hack like them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;atinm&gt; so its harder.</span><br />
